Offered annually in the fall semester. Prerequisites: high school biology, chemistry, and physics; concurrent registration in MATH 119 or MATH 120 is recommended.",

In addition to studying the conventions, patterns, and practices that inform the literary and visual treatments of these conflicts, students will explore historical and theoretical concerns that address the handling of violence and trauma, links between the combat film and war photography, filmic realism and authenticity, and Hollywood’s conceptualization of war and counter-narratives that challenge it.",

Students will read a variety of secondary works that place the Holocaust in historical context and identify important scholarly debates. Students will examine a range of primary sources (e.g., survivors’ testimony, photographs, official documents) to explore issues raised in interpreting certain types of Holocaust evidence. Finally, students will view a number of films, including Shoah, Schindler’s List, and Life is Beautiful, to consider how the Holocaust can be portrayed to a broad public in an historically and politically responsible way.

Over the last four hundred years, the entire globe has become a stage for Shakespeare’s plays, and this course will chart some of those journeys through space and time. We will study five of Shakespeare’s plays from several genres (comedy, tragedy, history), first placing them in their initial historical context, and then examining how these works have been translated, adapted, appropriated, revised and represented in performances around the world. Examples such of global responses may include Sulayman Al-Bassam’s The Al-Hamlet Summit, which transfers Shakespeare’s political upheaval to a contemporary Arabic context; Omkara, a Bollywood adaptation of Othello; and an Israeli production of The Merchant of Venice. If possible, the class will attend a performance of one of the plays on our syllabus; tickets and transportation will come to no more than $25. “Global Shakespeares” carries ALS-L credit, and counts as a pre-1800 course and a Cross-Disciplinary course for the English major.

This course examines medieval Asian societies and their visitors as they dealt with and adapted to what some Europeans thought was the coming of the apocalypse. While Europe never experienced the doomsday they feared, many other countries in Asia had to engage directly with them, changing their societies forever. To get a look at how these societies adapted and how such a devastating conquest could end up opening super-long-distance trade routes, this class will read, Chinese, Japanese, Muslim, and European travel writing as well as other primary and secondary sources that examine what life was like after the Mongols assembled the biggest land empire in human history.",

		"desc": "Historian Pierre Sorlin observed in the 1970s that most people get their knowledge about the past from movies, not from books or History courses. Films are powerful vehicles for immersing us in worlds from different times and places, establishing a narrative, showing us change over time, and developing an interpretation. Yet over four decades after Sorlin’s observation, historian Robert Rosenstone, himself a champion of using film to study history, noted that historical films still “trouble and disturb” most professional historians. Why is the common focus on the past shared by film and historical study so problematic? In what ways do film and historical study complement each other to help us understand the past? These are the big questions that inspire this course. To begin answering these questions, History 299 focuses on ways in which film has portrayed seminal developments and events—and the contexts that produced them--in twentieth-century European history. We’ll “read” films as historical texts and explore their “meaning-making” capacity. We’ll treat some films as primary sources; we’ll examine others to consider how visions of the past bear upon the present—for instance, how a particular age or generation seeks a “useable” past. We’ll compare filmic and current scholarly interpretations of the past to understand better the role of each in shaping historical memory. ORC credit.",

Students will read and write about sci-fi novels and short stories by influential authors from H.G. Wells to Kim Stanley Robinson. Considering the importance of cinema to the sci-fi genre, the seminar will also host a number of screenings. The course is likely to include Wells’s War of the Worlds, Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Octavia E. Butler's Parable of the Sower, along with film classics such as A Trip to the Moon, 2001, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and Arrival.
