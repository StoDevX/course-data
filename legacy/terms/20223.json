Multi-ethnic peoples have always populated the massive geographic area that comes to be known as \"Russia.\" How did the state at various times in history seek to integrate, assimilate or rule over ethnic and religious minorities? What were the strategies and practices of imperial rule under the Romanov monarchy? How and why did policies of assimilation alternate with policies of tolerance, and why were these policies unevenly applied? How did the Soviet project define national identity? We will consider these questions over a broad sweep of history with the goal of identifying analytical categories and models that are appropriate to the Russian context. The course will also introduce key theoretical texts on national identity, colonialism and imperialism. We will interrogate these theories and test them against the Russian version of colonial rule -- a colonialism that differed from European models yet, some would argue, has persisted to this day. Finally, we will consider (to the extent possible) the perspective of colonized peoples and what an alternative narrative history of Russian expansion might look like \"from below.\"",

Girls make up billions of dollars in the consumer media industry, yet also suffer disproportionately from the increasing disappearance of protections for privacy and personal freedom. Girl culture is critically shaped by issues of race, gender, and class informing not only the experiences of girlhood but those of the women they will become. From play to trafficking, \"alternative\" forms of aggression and bullying, education and empowerment, gossip, social justice, bodies and body image, media, friendships, gender identity and trans issues, puberty, dreams of becoming a scientist or a Youtube star, we will explore the many facets of being a girl.",

This seminar is designed for students interested in the political, cultural, and historical impact of sports and physical culture. You do not need to be a collegiate athlete--or even particularly sporty--to enroll! Some of our guiding questions for the semester include: When did organized athletics emerge--and what implications does that hold for us today? How do national and international interests collide in the arena of sports? Can and should sporting achievement be viewed independently of other contexts? How can we understand and analyze sports as \"physical culture\"? What athletic pursuits and other physical cultures matter to our St. Olaf campus community? In this seminar, we will use tools from the fields of cultural and literary analysis to think, talk, and write about the present, past, and future of sports and physical culture--from the intramural clubs at St. Olaf to international competitions like the Olympic Games. We will analyze historical and contemporary source texts, craft and debate persuasive arguments, research and write about physical culture(s), and reflect on our shared physical, emotional, and critical-rhetorical growth at St. Olaf.",

In this seminar, we will think and write alongside intersectional writers and activists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Kimberlé Crenshaw, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde as we build more complex understandings of the relationships between gender, race, sexuality, class, and other aspects of identity. Through encounters with many types of texts--including poems, personal essays, scholarly articles, videos, manifestos, and social media posts--you'll sharpen your critical thinking, close reading, argumentation, and research skills. You will not only write about intersectionality, but also will practice intersectional methods--teasing out nuances, imagining new frameworks, and holding in mind conflicting ideas--that will allow you to grow as a writer and person. Assignments will include individual essays, a presentation in pairs, and a group podcast that discusses research-based, practical applications of intersectionality for everyday life, our campus community, and the wider culture.",

We will focus on the historical circumstances and unique spaces out of which hip-hop has arisen as well as the culture's own conceptions of history, social life, and aesthetics, or what you might call its poetics of place. Our study of hip-hop culture will encourage us to think about writing as a process, a practice of daily attention and development. To this end, you will learn to write in diverse formats, from close listening exercises and album reviews to personal reflection papers and a research-driven essay.

Today it commonly refers to people, nations, pets, businesses, and online avatars associated with people we may never have met. Why is friendship so resonant across temporal and cultural contexts and yet so hard to define? Is friendship a preference for individual people or an obligation we have to each and every person we encounter? To what extent is friendship gendered? Does friendship play different roles in different cultures, and if so, how do we talk about intercultural friendships? In this seminar, we'll draw on literature, film, philosophy, journalism, and visual art in order to consider existing philosophies of friendship and to develop our own.

Questions we may address include: what's in a name? why do we lie? what words convey apology? how does language matter in our campus community? Readings in non-fiction and drama support class discussions of those questions and also model different writing \"moves.\" During our study of language in drama, the class will also attend a production of the play we are studying. Students synthesize reading and viewing assignments, discussion, personal experience, and the results of their inquisitive research to write in several modes and genres.

Using dialogue as the primary driver of story and character, this class will introduce students to various dramatic techniques that will help them write short plays that engage the audience and lead to a satisfying theatrical experience. Students will be encouraged to draw characters and conflicts from their own lives and take full advantage of their unique worlds to give their work authenticity. Weekly playwriting exercises will be supported by reading and analyzing a new play every week. These will be mostly contemporary plays and will tie in thematically to the exercises. Students will take turns breaking down different aspects of the play be it plot, subtext, punctuation, a playwright's history, to more extrinsic aspects of the theatre such as conceptualizing costumes, imagining the play in a site-specific setting, or designing a poster for a new production. In addition, students will be responsible for writing one theatre review of a play (possibly a St. Olaf production), as well as writing a final paper that will be tailored to their chosen field of interest relating to theatre.",

In this seminar, we will analyze the idea of the \"single story.\" We'll start by interrogating the single stories we're familiar with in our cultural contexts, academic experiences, and personal lives. Who creates these stories? Why do they do so? How do these narratives take root? We will then seek out works that challenge these master narratives by addressing the same topic from another angle: a different author's perspective, a different discipline's approach, or a different culture's beliefs, to name a few. As we dismantle the idea of a \"single story,\" we will read many narratives, and write our own, and explore a complex, vibrant collection of stories.",

How do the experiences of the imperial past resonate in the postcolony and the (ex-)metropole? And what place have the literary arts occupied within this conversation? We will inform our encounters with literature by reading in the fields of postcolonial studies, history, film, the visual arts, music, and dance.

If the liberationist strategy of insurrection almost always fails, is it unjustifiable to violently resist one’s oppressor, even if this is the only viable path to liberation? How would philosophical theorizing (say, ethics and political philosophy) change if it had to start from the premise of oppression rather than a premise of freedom? How does an abolitionist perspective (rather than a gradualist perspective) change how we think about contemporary justice issues--e.g., responsibility for implicit bias or prison reform? Who are the philosophers theorizing the liberationist strategies and virtues necessary to overcome oppression? What do they have to say about these issues, the current state of professional philosophy, and the power dynamics that limit philosophical thinking? In addition to considering these questions, we will consider liberationist perspectives on racism and antiracism, the relationship of Black Lives Matter to the Black Power movement, the ongoing controversy over Critical Race Theory, and whether it is possible or desirable to study oppressed groups without keeping score about which groups suffer most. This course satisfies the Expanding Perspectives distribution requirement for the philosophy major.",

Students will be encouraged to draw characters and conflicts from their own lives and take full advantage of their unique worlds to give their work authenticity. Weekly playwriting exercises will be supported by reading and analyzing a new play every week. These will be mostly contemporary plays and will tie in thematically to the exercises. Students will take turns breaking down different aspects of the play be it plot, subtext, punctuation, a playwright's history, to more extrinsic aspects of the theatre such as conceptualizing costumes, imagining the play in a site-specific setting, or designing a poster for a new production. In addition, students will be responsible for writing one theatre review of a play (possibly a St. Olaf production), as well as writing a final paper that will be tailored to their chosen field of interest relating to theatre.",

Rather than myopically understanding Russia and the U.S. as states historically hostile to queer rights, we will see how Russian and American literature and film has created a multitude of identities and sexualities in these societies.

These methods and methodologies will help you develop a critical framework to analyze and examine difference (e.g., racial, gendered, class, sexual, religious, national) in American society and culture, as we engage in readings that illuminate structures of power and expose the contradictions of concepts such as equality, democracy, citizenship, and the American dream. By the end of this seminar, you will leave equipped with the reading, thinking, and writing skills to a) help you succeed academically; b) aid you in challenging white supremacist/Eurocentric understandings of history, culture, and society; and c) write/dream a new world.",

To help us investigate these topics thoughtfully, we will draw from literary nonfiction, history, sociology, literary criticism, philosophy, and journalism. These readings will come from both traditional academic sources as well as popular ones.

Through in-class discussions, research, and writing assignments, students will analyze how science shapes and is shaped by its social contexts, discuss the methods that natural and social sciences use to examine phenomena, and interrogate the very nature of science itself.

We will map them, measure them, and uncover their stories. Then we will look at how these spaces might be improved in order to better fit the needs of today's (and tomorrow's) Oles.",

In this course, students examine what historical conditions have given rise to monsters like vampires, zombies, and other blood-thirsty creatures, and theorize on why monsters seem to (un)naturally (re)adapt to our ever-changing ways of life. By considering myths from around the world, students trace the roots of these monsters and locate contexts where these monsters have found newer homes and renewed relevance. But monsters are hardly phenomena solely tied to the past: they also lurk in the future, in the unknown, in how the \"normal\" is constructed. The course puts monsters into conversation with anxieties around race, glass, gender, indigeneity versus foreignness, immigration, illness, disability, technology, political ideologies, and much more. After this course, students will never see monsters the same way again.",
