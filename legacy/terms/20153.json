The reason given is that the Bible seems to commend or depict without obvious criticism actions, policies and attitudes that many would regard today as immoral (e.g., genocide, child sacrifice, slavery, holy war, gender discrimination, heterosexism, ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism, masochism, destructive self-denial, or harmfully restrictive views of marriage, divorce and sexuality). But how can the Bible be “immoral” if, as the Christian tradition insists, scripture is supposed to serve as a source of moral wisdom (e.g., with the Ten Commandments or Jesus’ command to love the neighbor or the Sermon on the Mount)?

The reason given is that the Bible seems to commend or depict without obvious criticism actions, policies and attitudes that many would regard today as immoral (e.g., genocide, child sacrifice, slavery, holy war, gender discrimination, heterosexism, ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism, masochism, destructive self-denial, or harmfully restrictive views of marriage, divorce and sexuality). But how can the Bible be “immoral” if, as the Christian tradition insists, scripture is supposed to serve as a source of moral wisdom (e.g., with the Ten Commandments or Jesus’ command to love the neighbor or the Sermon on the Mount)? In this section we address (among other things) the Bible as moral problem.",

This section of 121 takes these current conversations about race and racial injustice as a starting point. We will work through contemporary cultural biblical studies and engage contemporary critical race theory along the way. Alongside biblical texts, we’ll read poets like Claudia Rankine and her prophetic lyric Citizen, Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me, womanist scholarship like Kelly Brown Douglas' Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God, and theologian James Cone’s most recent work, The Cross and the Lynching Tree.",

Both Judaism and Christianity have claimed the Hebrew Bible (or “Old Testament”) as the foundational text of their traditions. Throughout the centuries, both traditions have developed distinctive reading strategies for making sense of the diverse and complicated texts they regard as scripture. This course takes a thematic approach to topics in the Hebrew Bible that were important and sometimes divisive for its later readers, including the authors of the New Testament. These themes include law, prophecy, kingship, and the Temple in Jerusalem. For each of these topics, we will study important passages from the Hebrew scriptures and then examine related passages from rabbinic midrash (a form of biblical interpretation that has played a significant role in the development of Judaism) and the New Testament. Through attentive and active participation in this course, students will attain a basic familiarity with biblical texts, themes, and genres and understand some of the tools with which scholars approach them. In addition, this course seeks to help students become adept at the interpretation of texts and the practice of close reading, skills useful not only in biblical or religious studies but in all academic fields.",

Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it “the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people’s minds.” Language—spoken, signed, and written—is one of the most important ways we influence others and construct ourselves. This seminar is ideal for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its changes over time and space, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we will address include: How does gender impact our language? How has the English language changed in the last 450 years? Why are “bad words” bad? How do advertisers manipulate language? What does txtng do 2 yr language? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama show us how some authors have thought through these questions. We discuss these authors’ ideas and the “moves” they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience and the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of multiple drafts.",

This is a seminar about learning to read pictures, whether you know much about art or not, and sharing our understanding of pictures by writing ever more capably as the semester progresses about nature imagery from various periods of American history. A relatively short research project will combine students’ skills in reading nature imagery with insight into how groups battling over environmental and energy exploration issues have employed landscapes and pictures of animals and plants to advance their positions.",

We will learn how to make an argument that can stand up to scrutiny and criticism.

		"desc": "20TH CENTURY AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE DEATH OF THE DREAM. The recent economic downturn—what many have called a collapse—has raised concerns regarding the financial health of future generations. It is now widely accepted that the potential for younger Americans to do better than previous generations—the narrative of social mobility popularly understood as the American Dream—is no longer a reality. Instead, there is a growing consensus regarding the death of this dream and with it the very possibility to improve one’s economic, social, and cultural condition. It seems that rather than progressing toward a healthy democracy, the United States has spiraled into a science fiction reality where the media controls our thinking, politics is governed by self-interest, and corporations are powerful enough to hire private armies to impose their will around the globe. This seminar centers on twentieth century American culture, particularly as it relates to issues of historical progress, national identity, cultural change, and aesthetic experimentation. The main question we will address is “What has happened to the American Dream?” In addition to literature, we will also read some philosophical and political texts. Requirements will include short writing assignments, a mid-term paper, and a final paper. Some of the texts we will discuss include The Yellow Wallpaper, as well as films like There Will Be Blood, The Corporation, Revolutionary Road, and Fight Club.",

This seminar has a special emphasis on reading, writing, and thinking through the lens of critical literacy: how we acquire language, how we use language, how language uses us. It will not be a strict nuts and bolts approach to the writing and language practices that will be expected of you at St. Olaf, though rest assured, these practices will be discussed. More importantly, we will learn to gain agency both in and out of higher education by purposely shaping our language for particular rhetorical situations. Choosing our words carefully is both an act of rebellion and leadership, and by doing so we will together become better readers, writers, and stewards of the English language.",

Yet, in the public protests and debates that have followed events such as the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, activists, scholars, political leaders, journalists, and—not least of all—college students have pointed to the shortcomings of the contemporary dialogue about race. This seminar is intended to address this need. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the role of race in aspects of twenty-first-century American life including education, housing, jobs, and the law; examine its presence on contemporary college campuses; and trace its appearance in popular culture. Readings and other materials for this distinctly interdisciplinary course will be drawn from the social sciences, the arts, and the humanities.",

Using readings from journalism, nonfiction, and fiction, this seminar examines the concept of crossing borders-- geographically as well as metaphorically. Why leave home, why breach a boundary, how do people retain their humanity while crossing and creating a new life on the other side? Issues we explore include “border syndrome” as an emotional state (Gazmend Kapllani, A Border Crossing Handbook), undocumented immigration to the United States (Sonia Nazario, Enrique’s Journey ), cross-class identity in pre- and post-revolution China (Yua Hua, To Live), the body’s borders and the limits of medicine (the NY Times journalist who reported on the Ebola crisis), and the thin line between life and death (Markus Zusak, The Book Thief ). We focus on the process of writing and on contextual research in short assignments, with each student’s work culminating in a “dense” description of one border crossing.",

Nobel Prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen once proposed that we could now call our present moment in geologic history the “Anthropocene”— the time of pervasive human power shaping life on Earth. Reflecting on this era, a number of contemporary writers and environmental philosophers wrestle with devastating environmental realities from human-caused global warming to mass extinctions to contemporary use of technology. They attempt to write the intricacies of earthen tragedy, beauty and responsibility in the human age. This seminar explores writing that takes on that task of thinking about the Anthropocene. Each reflects on the porous and shifting borders of what counts as “human” and “nonhuman,” “natural” and “unnatural.” We’ll read Elizabeth Kolbert’s chronicle of species loss in The Sixth Extinction, Alison Hawthorne Deming’s personal essay-meditations on various species in Zoologies, and a range of fiction writers and poets such as Todd Davis, Ross Gay, and Pattiann Rogers as they attempt to write about life and death on Earth in new and provoking ways.",

The subjects we’ll read about will be diverse: from definitions of sustainability to manifestos about hunting, from encounters with weasels to the absence of encounters with golden frogs, from the problems with consumption to the possibilities of cell phones as purveyors of green change.

This seminar will explore three media (literature, theater, and film) and two genres (comedy and tragedy), by way of thinking about the structures and strategies of fictional narratives. What human themes/experiences/ideas in these stories are \"universal\"? What is distinctive about the ways they can be communicated by each of the three media? In each medium, we’ll explore texts both classic (Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice) and contemporary (a film by Spike Lee; contemporary fiction by a Northfield-based writer with a national reputation). Our class will attend two staged theater productions (professional theater in Minneapolis/St. Paul and a St. Olaf production). We’ll read novels both comic and tragic and watch films ranging from a 1930s screwball comedy to a contemporary urban tragedy. Writing assignments, formal and informal, will be frequent and varied, and will include visual analyses both of theatrical staging and film techniques, critical literary analysis, a research paper on film history, and a \"creative\" opportunity to try your hand at screenwriting.",

		"desc": "STORYTELLING WITH DATA. This is the age of Big Data, and data is informing decisions in fields from medicine to finance to politics to education. To be an informed citizen, as H.G. Wells forecasted, statistical literacy has become as important as the ability to read and write. In this seminar, we will focus on reading and writing about statistics for a wide audience. Through readings in books such as Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver, and Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, we will explore questions such as: Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? Why are earthquakes so dangerous to predict? Why are so many Canadian Olympic hockey players born in January? At its core, the effective communication of data stems from the art of storytelling and the ability to ask creative, insightful questions. We will study how popular authors tell stories with data – using detective narratives, underdog triumphs, and contrasts with anecdotal evidence – and we will engage in the writing process to tell stories involving data that provide insights into the world around us.",

Some of the readings will be drawn from recognized classics in the field while others will arise from contemporary debates about political issues and cultural diversity within the U.S. The course pays considerable attention to historical shifts in political thought but is not designed to provide a chronology of the great Western political thinkers. Instead, this course aims to provoke and sustain a semester-long exploration of what it means to be a political actor -- that is, a citizen -- and what it means to think about politics.

				"desc": "370A American Revolution: History and Historians - Professor Hahn - Many American historians would argue that the American Revolution was the defining event in United States history. Take away the colonists' rebellion and hard-fought separation from Great Britain and what is left is a country devoid of much of its political and cultural character. The problem, as John Adams recognized, is that the Revolution, then as now, meant different things to different people, making it a difficult subject about which to write. As a result, generations of historians have interpreted the origins and consequences of the Revolution in a variety of creative and contradictory ways. The aim of this course is not only to examine the American Revolution's key events, but also to explore the various interpretations of its origins and consequences. Students will read from a diverse body of literature derived from several scholarly traditions, addressing questions such as: How radical was the revolution? Who made the Revolution happen? Who benefited most? Why did some refuse to support it? Why 1776? As we will see, the debates surrounding such questions remain heated and contested to this day, proof positive of the Revolution's enduring legacy. What we may find is that the Revolution's final chapter, in some sense, has yet to be written.\n****************************************************************************************************\n370B Civil Rights - Professor Fitzgerald - From Segregation to Civil Rights, this course examines the scholarly literature on the origins and outcome of the Civil Rights movement, basically 1900 to the 1970s, from the origins of Jim Crow to its overthrow. The primary focus will be on the South, and how southern racial issues played out before the nation and the world, particularly via the media. The class will culminate with an original research paper drawing on the range of primary sources available. Relevant coursework on African-American history, the Civil War era, recent US history, or lynching is strongly recommended.",

During four years of hardship and uncertainty, both the Vichy regime and French resistance groups attempted to remake France by developing competing visions of the nation. Upon the Liberation of Paris, a victorious Charles de Gaulle spoke of a nation of resisters \"from the first hour.\" The historical record and contested nature of French national memory, however, make clear that the truth is more complex. In this course we'll use both primary and secondary sources to examine the perspectives of the historical actors and the interpretations of historical scholars. We'll also consider the distinctive ways in which literature and film shape an understanding of French experience during the war years. Finally, since this course is a Majors Seminar (M-sem), we'll pay particular attention to the way historians do their work.",

We'll learn more about Black Power, the summer Olympics, George Wallace's segregationist \"law and order\" campaign and how that helped Richard Nixon win election. We'll listen to songs, watch films, read essays. 1968 is a year in a time period that is mythologized history, and we'll think hard about how and why the era is mythologized, as we do our own exploration about that year. All students will do a final project in the last few weeks of the term, taking up some issue after 1968 to see the continuities and differences.",

This will involve meditating on a woods at hand, Norway Valley, with special emphasis on what thinkers in the arts and humanities such as Thoreau in Walden and poets and photographers teach us about trees, woods and valuing nature. Would it be a loss if St. Olaf cut down the Norway Valley trees and used the land for other purposes? Who, if anyone would mourn or worry about such a loss and why?

From deployments in war to representations in spirituality, from wild herds to circus spectacles, from complex emotional intelligence to the ivory trade, interactions with elephant life have shaped what it means to be human in intricate, wondrous, tragic, violent, and often unexamined ways. This arts and humanities emphasis course seeks to interrogate assumptions about nature and culture, humanity and animality, companionship and exploitation, intelligence and compassion, violence and ecological justice. We do so by journeying through the entangled lives of humans and elephants in biology, history, cultural representation, psychology, and contemporary conservation efforts. We might very well ask, as Caitrin Nicol Keiper does in a recent essay interrogating our \"elephantasies,\" “Whether there are millions or just one, what does it mean that there is such a thing as Elephant?",

What sources do they use for this research? What significance do we find in these histories of everyday life? Much of this study is defined by changes in social and cultural history, with an emphasis on local and micro-histories. Students will produce a substantial research paper, based on primary sources and focused on a theme or problem related to histories of everyday life. Seniors are welcome. Juniors especially are encouraged to consider this course, especially those considering academic internships, participation in the summer undergraduate research program, or distinction. Not offered in 2014-15."

We'll read about crucial historical events that shaped myths, and current events that \"could only happen in California.\" We'll consider the importance of landscape and region. We'll examine the gold rush and Silicon Valley, Hollywood and water, the border issues of the \"tortilla curtain,\" environmental matters.

This course challenges that assumption by asking what love and justice have in common in biblical writings stretching across Old and New Testaments. Some of the questions we’ll consider include: How do different settings, such as family, clan and community, national and international relations, affect biblical perspectives on justice? How are these differing perspectives reflected in the various genres of biblical writing such as narrative, law, prophecy, wisdom, and apocalyptic? Where do we see biblical writers wrestling with problems posed by the apparent lack of justice? Is there any point at which love and justice part company? Can there be love without justice, or justice without love? Finally, how might these perspectives help us reflect on contemporary problems?",

It is almost impossible to escape digital technologies in our day-to-day lives, including in our academic work – and why would we want to? Digital technologies offer innovative possibilities for refashioning ourselves, creating communities, and producing academic knowledge in the twenty-first century; on the other hand, digital technologies might also prove harmful to meaningful pen-and-paper work that has been done in the liberal arts for centuries. This course will investigate our preconceptions of “new” technologies to continue developing a critical digital literacy for learning and working with technology in the liberal arts. Possible assignments include critical reflection about our experiences with technology, film review, critical literary review, persuasive essay, and researched multimedia project. This course does not require any technological knowledge, and readings will draw from the humanities, social sciences, and technological sciences.",
