	ASIAN 215: Asian Conversations II: Encountering Asia
	(2010-2011, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students pursue guided fieldwork experience in the country whose language they study, either Japan or China. Activities and readings in this course build on the topics from Asian Studies 210 and three semesters of language study. Students continue to explore their understanding of Asia through ethnographic observation, interviews, and site visits. Students develop projects and follow a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct "Asian" culture and society today. Prerequisite: Asian Studies 210. Offered during interim. </p>
