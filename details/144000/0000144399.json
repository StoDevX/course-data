		"Since 1492, Latin America has been a site of (often violent) coexistence between people from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. This course examines race in Latin American history from 1492 to the present. We will ask how people created racial hierarchies through processes of colonization, enslavement and modernization, and examine how race has shaped peoples' access to physical security, social mobility and material well-being. With a focus on the politics and ideas of people who challenged white supremacy, we will assess the failures and successes of antiracist politics in Latin American history."
