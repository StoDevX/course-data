		"In this seminar course, we will address fundamental questions concerning the molecular biology of disease. Using the primary literature, we will learn how disease-associated alleles lead to altered gene expression or protein function and the effect of these altered genes and proteins on cellular function. Students will help shape the course by choosing specific topics that interest them. The main focus of the course will involve learning from and working with recently published scientific articles. There will also be lectures on background information and other class activities, including student presentations. Also, students will investigate a particular topic through a guided literature project. Prerequisites: BIO227 or CH/BI227 and BIO 233."
