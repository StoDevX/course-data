	ID 240: Literature and the Preservation of the Common Good
	(2008-2009, Summer Session 2)
	</p>
<p> A pilot course of the College's Emergency Curriculum, this is an online, Moodle-based course. "Class time " will be one of the online activities: students and professors will communicate using the real-time chat function that Moodle provides. </p><p> The course is meant to provide students with the collective wisdom of a variety of writers, from biblical times to present, on how to think philosophically about a crisis and how to conduct oneself during that crisis. Students read literature dedicated to "preserving the common good" in relation to human suffering in a variety of crises (war, dislocation, disease, systematic injustice). The thesis of the course is that literature of all kinds helps people understand the emergency or crisis through moral, religious, or other philosophical lenses in order to encourage them to think beyond their own well-being to a concern for the common good. </p>
