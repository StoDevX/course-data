	REL 251: Religion and Cultural Diversity in South Africa (Abroad)
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Through visits to the area around Cape Town and Johannesburg/Pretoria, this course examines cultural diversity in South Africa and the important role religion has played in shaping and sustaining the identity of various ethnic and racial groups. Students study the way religious ideas were used to defend the apartheid system and also to justify protest against it. They analyze organizations, post-apartheid, to build a multi-racial democracy and a just social order. Prerequisite: BTS-B. Offered during Interim 2009-10. </p>
