	REL 238: Quest of the Ring, the Grail, and the Cross
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Modern and ancient sagas and fantastic works pose important theological questions such as the nature of reality in fantasy, the Eucharist, honor, gift, the grotesque, evil, salvation in Christ, and life as a quest and pilgrimage. They also raise valuable problems about the relationship of Christian beliefs to cultural narratives. Students may read J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, G.K. Chesterton, and selected sagas, alongside of theological writings. Prerequisite: Completion of BTS-B requirement. Offered during Interim. </p>
