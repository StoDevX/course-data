	ENGL 276: Literature and the Environment
	(2009-2010, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Through nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, students explore the complex relations between humans and the "natural" world. Students consider questions such as: What does it mean to have connected to a landscape? What is a sense of place? Students also reflect about how they and the writers they read put landscape and experiences into language. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. </p>
