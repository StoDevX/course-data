	AMST 208: American Studies: Ideals to Action: Cultivating Social Change
	(2012-2013, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This class explores social change in the U.S. from a number of different perspectives. Through historical analysis, theoretical readings, case studies, ethical reflection, and practical application, students investigate local and global problems and assess a range of approaches to bring about change. The paths to change this course examines include social entrepreneurship and innovation, grassroots development, community organizing, labor organizing, electoral politics, and policy advocacy. In addition to studying this broad landscape of social change, a major component of this course requires students to select, plan, and begin to carry out work on a community project that addresses a particular issue or problem. In this way, the course integrates a hand-on approach that encourages students to apply the analytical skills, practical tools, and organizational knowledge needed to cultivate change and engage fully as a citizen. </p>
