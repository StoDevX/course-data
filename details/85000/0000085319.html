	(2011-2012, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course explores the changing structure of American business, the role of the individual in business development, and the challenges and opportunities that the corporate system poses for individuals, government, and society in general. The course uses basic economic concepts but does not require extensive knowledge of economic theory. The course follows a topics-based approach, considering the evolution of business and contemporary issues confronting corporations. Class discussions, small group activities, and guest speakers provide a varied pedagogical approach. Offered occasionally during Interim. </p>
