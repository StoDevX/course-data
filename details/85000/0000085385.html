	FILM 310: Filmmakers/Film Theorists
	(2011-2012, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> What is the relationship between film criticism and fimmaking? How is analysis a critical practice that informs the art and craft of filmmaking? In Filmmakers/Film Theorists we will consider these questions by focusing on film artists who also write film criticism or theory. Some case studies that may be explored include: the American, Soviet, and French avant-garde; the European New Waves; the Dogme '95 collective; and filmmakers Pier Paolo Pasolini, Agnes Varda, and Robert Bresson. Prerequisite: Film 101 or permission of instructor. </p>
