	ASIAN 397: Seminar: Human Rights/Asian Context
	(2012-2013, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that "the inherent dignity and ... the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [are] the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." Who speaks to human rights in East Asia? What ethical perspectives are voiced? Case studies presented through memoirs, films, reports, and multidisciplinary analyses provide the material for exploring diverse normative claims about individual rights in East Asia. Prerequisites: Asian Studies 275 or permission of the instructor and completion of BTS-T. Offered annually. </p>
