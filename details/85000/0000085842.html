	BIO 383: Evolutionary Biology
	(2012-2013, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> The idea of evolution forms the foundation for all modern biological thought. This course examines the processes of evolution in detail (selection, genetic drift, mutation, migration) and studies the methods by which biologists reconstruct the history of life on the planet. Advanced topics are explored through reading and discussion of journal articles. The social and historical context of evolutionary theory is discussed. Prerequisites: Biology 125, 126 and 233; or Chemistry/Biology 125-127 and Biology 126 and 233. </p>
