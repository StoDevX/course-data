	ENVST 381: Advanced Research Topics in Environmental Studies
	(2014-2015, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> EnvSt 381 Contested Spaces (ARTS/HUMANITIES)- Mark Allister This course will cover basic hydrological concepts within the context of water resources management and anthropogenic impacts on water quantity and quality. It will include an introduction to the basic physical principles of the hydrologic cycle including precipitation, snowmelt, infiltration, evapotranspiration, soil water storage, surface and subsurface flow to streams, groundwater and stream flow. The course will be a combination of lecture, discussion, mathematical models, and hands-on measurement of hydrological processes. Examples of models we will cover include instream flow, habitat, and water quality. Students aim to understand an "integral ecology" that might reveal all that is at stake in a contested environmental space. </p>
