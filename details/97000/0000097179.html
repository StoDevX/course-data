<p> This course introduces students to the complicated relationship between philosophy and literature from any period between the 16th-century and the present day. Students learn about the intersection of ideas that fall under the general category of "modernity" and explore how selected philosophical views influence American and/or English literary works from the Renaissance to the contemporary period. Students gain an understanding of modern philosophies by learning how to incorporate interdisciplinary theories when engaging in literary analysis. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically. </p>
