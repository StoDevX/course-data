	GREEK 374: Greek Drama
	(2014-2015, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Like the genre that it describes, the word <i>drama</i> is itself of Greek origin. From the treasure-trove left to us by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Menander, students translate one or two complete plays and discuss the evolution of the Greek theater, staging, and modern interpretations. Offered alternate years. Prerequisite: GREEK 231 or equivalent. </p>
