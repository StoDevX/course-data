	PHYS 376: Quantum Mechanics
	(2014-2015, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Students investigate Quantum Theory, in which a particle's behavior is described through a statistically-interpreted wave function rather than through the concepts of Newtonian mechanics. Topics include an examination of the conceptual framework of Quantum Mechanics, solution of the Schrodinger Equation for systems such as the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, and approximation methods for treating more complex systems and the interaction of radiation with matter. Prerequisites: PHYS 244 and PHYS 374, MATH 226, and concurrent registration in PHYS 386. Offered annually in the fall semester. </p>
