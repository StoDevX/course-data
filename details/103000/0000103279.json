		"Colonized in its early period by Phoenicians, Romans, and Visigoths, for over seven centuries the Iberian Peninsula was home to three distinct religious traditions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  Medieval Spain often is presented as a model of interfaith cooperation (convivencia), but historians continue to debate this co-existence.  This course traces the broad narrative of Iberian history from antiquity through the 16th century, focusing on the interactions of Christians, Muslims, and Jews."
