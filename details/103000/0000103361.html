	HIST 397: History Research Workshop
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>How do societies collectively remember, and how do they forget? Why do some events and figures from the past loom large in the collective imagination and are memorialized in museums, monuments, literature, film and song, while others of equal importance slip into oblivion? This seminar focuses both on the why of collective remembering and forgetting, as well on the mechanisms by which memories are transmitted over the generations. While some of the literature and specific case studies refer to Latin America, the topics and theoretical literature are broad in scope and can be applied to any geographical region. This course is suitable for students specializing in any of the sub-fields offered by the History Department. </p>
