		"Age of Revolution - This course examines some of the major political, economic, social, and ideological changes that swept over a large geographic region that historians commonly refer to as the\" Atlantic World\" -- Europe, Africa, and the Americas, which were connected together across the Atlantic Ocean by the exchange of goods, ideas, and people.  Topics include popular sovereignty, liberalism, abolitionism, religion and science, familial relations, and the significance of the Haitian Revolution.  Although the course focuses mostly on the American, Haitian, and Latin American revolutions, gaining a global understanding of the importance of the Age of Revolution is a primary goal of this course."
