	BIO 391: Selected Topics
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>Rapid advances in stem cell biology are pushing the envelope in regenerative medicine and are accompanied by new social and ethical considerations. This course will examine (1) what stem cells are, (2) how they contribute to biological and developmental processes, and (3) their potential use treating disease and injury. We will read and discuss primary literature on the use of stem cells to treat conditions affecting organs and tissues throughout the body, such as the nervous system, muscle, and hematopoietic system. By examining these studies, we will practice critically analyzing scientific literature and reports of new biomedical advances. Students will conclude the course by writing a research proposal on a topic of their choice that relates to a therapeutic application of stem cell biology. Prerequisite: Completion of either Intermediate Genetics (BIO 233) or Cell Biology (BIO 125, BIO 227 or CH/BI 227). </p>
