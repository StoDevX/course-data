	REL 272: Sacred Places in Greece and Turkey (abroad)
	(2015-2016, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course explores the notion of sacred places and examines specific sites sacred to ancient people, to Christians, Muslims, and Jews. Students visit both natural places and constructed sites (i.e., temples, churches, mosques, and synagogues). Students attend to scholarly theory, sites' physical characteristics and history, ongoing human interaction, inter-religious dynamics, and their own responses. The interplay of religion, social life, and political power relative to sacred space provides additional thematic focus. Offered alternate years during Interim. Counts toward ancient studies major. Prerequisite: BTS-B. </p>
