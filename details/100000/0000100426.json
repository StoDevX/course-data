		"Holocaust and History - This seminar examines the Holocasut within the context of 20th-century European history and considers key issues and debates in historical study of the Holocaust.  Topics include: antisemitism; genesis of the Final Solution; the bureaucracy, process and personnel of extermination; individual and state complicity in the Holocaust; acts of resistance and rescue; evolution of the intentionalist/structuralist debate; representation and memorialization of the Holocaust.  Students use primary sources (survivor's testimony, photographs, official documents) to explore challenges historians face ininterpreting certain types of evidence, secondary sources to evaluate contested interpretations of the Holocaust, and film (<I>Shoah, Schindler's List, and Life is Beautiful</I>) to consider how to portray the Holocaust responsibly to the public."
