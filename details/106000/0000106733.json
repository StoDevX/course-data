		"From simulating population dynamics to mining molecular databases, computer programming is rapidly becoming essential to the study of a broad range of biological systems. This course introduces computer programming to biologists and allows for the creative application of this skill to an array of biological questions, with an emphasis on advanced genetics topics. Students will develop basic programming skills and will work collaboratively to develop novel solutions to biological problems. The final project will allow each student to develop a unique program in their own area of interest. Counts toward mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 233."
