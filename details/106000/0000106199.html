	ENGL 280A: Topics in Genre
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>This course explores the everydayness of psychopathology in American culture. Exploring various approaches, but emphasizing a psychoanalytic-Marxist methodology, we will analyze how pathology gets normalized in culture and how such pathologization obstructs or corrupts collective attempts at social justice. Stated differently, we will study how such pathologies arrest the development of social progress. Areas to be explored include madness, criminality, and politics. Texts and films/television series to be analyzed include <i>Dexter</i>, <i>Batman</i>, <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, <i>True Detective</i> (season one), and <i>American Psycho</i>. Prerequisite: FYW. See English Department website for more details. </p>
