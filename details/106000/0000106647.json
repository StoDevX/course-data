		"<b>Surveillance Literature and Cinema</b> -  This course privileges a theoretical approach to the topic of surveillance, while examining how literature and film understand and imagine the impact of surveillance on our behavior, bodies, and everyday lives. We also explore how the relationship between surveillance and vision has developed and changed, and consider the role of media in the diffusion of surveillance technologies. Course materials engage with everything from consumer surveillance, and the policing of gender and race, to sites of institutional, military, and state surveillance."
