	ENGL 228: Romantic/Victorian/Modern British Literature
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course explores British literature of three eras, from Wordsworth to Woolf. Students begin with the romantic revolution of the late 18th century, traverse the wide 19th-century span of Queen Victoria's reign, and cross into the modernist era following the cataclysm of World War I. Within each era, students examine a literary manifesto, a revolutionary event, an epic poem, a novel, and the aesthetics of the period. The course emphasizes conversations across eras and striking moments of "making it new." Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
