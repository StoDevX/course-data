	SOAN 267: Medical Anthropology
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> How do people understand illness and healing? How does social inequality shape health? These are among the questions explored by medical anthropology. In this course students examine the ways people in different societies experience their bodies, by looking at AIDS in Haiti, old age in India, and childbirth in the United States. Students investigate diverse understandings of health, different means of promoting healing, and the role of power in providing medical care. Offered annually in the fall or spring semester. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration (for students through class of 2016). </p>
