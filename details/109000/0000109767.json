		"WRITING ABOUT FILM.  This seminar explores various forms of film writing, from mainstream, popular reviews that understand cinema largely in relation to consumption and entertainment, to more theoretical essays that ask you to address film form within a broader framework. The course will introduce you to the basic terminology and language required for formal film analysis and criticism (mise-en-scene, editing, cinematography, genre, narrative, authorship, stardom), and ultimately ask that you incorporate this language into your own writing."
