	ENGL 392: Major American Authors
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>In this seminar well read novels about families. The novel as a form  with its narrative ability to move in and out of interior states, to create numerous plots and sub-plots  has been particularly suitable for capturing the near-dizzying relations of family members. To help us make better sense of the complex relations between characters and the worlds they inhabit, well dig deep into family systems theory and psychoanalytic theory. Texts for the course will be drawn from recent decades of American literature; novelists may include Jhumpa Lahiri, Richard Russo, Anne Tyler, Jonathan Franzen, and Dorothy Allison. </p>
