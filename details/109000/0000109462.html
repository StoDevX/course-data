	ENGL 220: Topics in Literary History
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>This course focuses on bodily experience and afterlives in and of literature from the fourteenth to the early seventeenth century. The corpse of the title refers to the human bodies in the texts we will study bodies that may experience pleasure, suffer pain and even martyrdom, and ultimately decay, as the spirit experiences some kind of afterlife. However, despite conceptions of the afterlife, the dead remained an important presence for the living, as intercessors, apparitions, ghosts and saints. The corpus is the body of a texta story that is revisited by artists over time, in an afterlife of its own, as Shakespeare re-writes Hamlet or The Revengers Tragedy is re-imagined by Alan Cox in a postmodern film. For the English major, this course counts as a Literary History course and a pre-1800 course. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
