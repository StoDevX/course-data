	PSYCH 221: Menacing Minds
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Psychopaths, blazing a path of disregard and devastation through life, are a chilling example of the darker side of humanity. Students critically compare psychopathy as protrayed in the popular media to psychology's theoretical and empirical understanding. They explore questions such as: What are the hallmark characteristics of a psychopath? Where can psychopaths be found? What causes psychopathy? Students also examine the question of what the existence of psychopathy means for the rest of us. Offered during Interim. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125. </p>
