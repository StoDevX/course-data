	ENGL 286: Topics in Rhetoric and Composition
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p>Games are neither literature nor films, but artifacts that include literary, filmic, multimodal, and interactive components. Therefore, in this class, students will push beyond the narrative or filmic aspects of games to ask how the playability of the game alters its rhetorical force. Students will write individual game analyses and create collaborative writing projects. While the course engages scholarship on rhetoric and video games, much of the class content will focus on students' writing. </p>
