	ENGL 255: Backgrounds to Lit in English: Allusion, Influence, and Intertextualit
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces students to canonical texts (for example, the epics of Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Dante, and medieval romance) and explores their influence on various authors writing in English (for example, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Aphra Behn, T.S. Eliot, H.D., William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Sam Selvon). Rather than study classic works as isolated masterpieces, students explore how and why later writers and artists use canonical texts to shape their vision of the human experience. Offered periodically. Course not open to students who are taking or have completed the Great Conversation. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
