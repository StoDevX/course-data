<p>If love makes the world go 'round, can it also play a role in restoring it? This course explores how affection for nature impacts physical environments and how authentic connection to other-than-human life might lead to human flourishing. Students study philosophical, religious and literary texts attending to themes of identity, human and spiritual development, the built environment and conservation ethics. Counts as an elective within the environmental studies arts-and-humanities area of emphasis. </p>
