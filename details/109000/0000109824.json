		"By 2030, one in five people will be aged 65 or older. This silver tsunami will be either a burden or an opportunity for society, depending on the extent to which we promote healthy cognitive aging. Our research this semester will examine adults of all ages to characterize patterns of stability and decline in cognition, as well as possible underlying neural mechanisms. Students will explore multidisciplinary issues, methods and theories in the studies of aging and learning and gain substantial hands-on research experience!  Prerequisite: Psych 125.  An application is required to register for this course.  Please contact Darla Frandrup for the link to the form."
