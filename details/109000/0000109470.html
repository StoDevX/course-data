	ENGL 399: The Major Seminar
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>This seminar is designed to compliment studies in literature and/or creative writing through the examination and application of rhetorical and composition (writing) theory. You will learn basic rhetorical analysis methodology. Rhetorical analysis examines what makes arguments effective for a specific purpose, audience, and context. By learning this methodology, you will improve your close reading, critical thinking, and writing skillsÂ—hallmarks of a graduating English major. You will also read and discuss contemporary composition theory, investigating what writing is, how it comes into being, and how it circulates. You will apply what we learn to issues, practices, and text (literary, digital, visual, and non-academic) to analyze contemporary uses of rhetoric and writing theory. See English Department website for more details. </p>
