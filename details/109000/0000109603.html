	ID 140: Health and Social Inequality: Rural and Urban Perspectives (off campus
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Health begins where we live, work and play. Students are immersed in public, private, and community-based organizations in Northfield (rural) and Minneapolis-St. Paul (urban) to gain an understanding of the social determinants of health (environmental conditions, resources and supports) and the relationship to individual health outcomes through service learning. A special emphasis is placed on the impact of socioeconomic status, geographic location, and disability on health disparities. Prerequisites: one course in sociology/anthropology, women's and gender studies, social work, family studies, economics, political science, environmental studies, or nursing. Offered during Interim. </p>
