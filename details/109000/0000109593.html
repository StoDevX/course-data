	ENGL 267: Monsters: Myths and Movies from the 19th to 21st Centuries
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course is centered around three 19th-century British novels: Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, R. L. Stevenson's <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, and Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>. Students explore the influence of these texts on mythical monsters from the 20th to 21st centuries in the form of classic black and white films of the 1930s, as well as more recent fictional and filmic incarnations. What do monsters tell readers about themselves? Assignments include both critical and creative writing. Offered periodically during Interim. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
