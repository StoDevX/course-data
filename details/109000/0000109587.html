	CLASS 129: The Neverending Myth: Ovid's Metamorphoses
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Ovid was the most witty and popular Roman poet of his time, and his 12,000-line <i>Metamorphoses</i>has influenced more European literature and art than any other classical Latin text. By analyzing two modern English translations and studying other poems, stories, and artwork based on the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, students gain an understanding of the nature of Ovid's storytelling and the power that it has exerted on our cultural tradition. Offered periodically during Interim. Counts toward ancient studies, classics, Greek, and Latin majors. </p>
