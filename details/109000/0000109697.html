	GREEK 370: Topics in Greek Literature
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>Although the existence of an ancient didactic genre is contested, nevertheless the didactic mode can be seen across a variety of literary works. In this course, students will examine didactic as it is present across several different Greek literary genres and evaluate different features of the didactic mode, including the teacher-persona, the internal and external audiences, <i>exempla</i>, and appeals to authority. Secondary literature will provide the theoretical background. Prerequisite: GREEK 231 or equivalent. </p>
