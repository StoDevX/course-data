	ENGL 251: Major Chicano/a Authors
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Chicano/a identity is perhaps one of the most misunderstood racial/ethnic identities in the United States. It encompasses many possible identities--such as Latino, Hispanic, and Mexican-American--while remaining politically and culturally distinct in its intended meaning. Students explore the history behind constructions of Chicano/a identity as expressed through Civil Rights Movement (post-1964) literature and politics, with the intention of demystifying the contentious sterotypes surrounding this community. Students read works by 3-4 major Chicano/a authors. Offered periodically. Counts toward Latin American studies major and concentration and race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
