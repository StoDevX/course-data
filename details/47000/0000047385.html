	ENGL 203B: Folklore
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Focuses on verbal folklore: narratives, songs and shorter forms such as proverbs. Explores the intrinsic qualities of each as literary creations and also the ways in which they operate together when combined or in dialogic relationship. The folktale or the epic, for example, incorporate a variety of these forms, such as the proverb, the song or the riddle, to form a complex whole. </p>
