		"This 100-level course will explore the history of misinformation in the US and beyond from the early 20th century to the present. We will observe the creation of new communications technologies and how they contributed to the circulation and suppression of ideas, beliefs, culture, and propaganda. From the Russian Revolution in 1917 to the Vietnam War, the rise of social media and beyond, we will explore crucial moments when media and misinformation have been used by governments, the press, and the culture industry to shape public opinion, influence the democratic process, and contribute to polarization at home and abroad."
