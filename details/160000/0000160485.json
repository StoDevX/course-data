		"Minnesota was home to indigenous peoples long before the arrival of the colonists whose legacy remains today in the form of American institutions, laws, and cultural conventions. In this course, students will take an in-depth look at some of the key events that shaped US-Dakota relations in Minnesota, along with other indigenous communities in the upper Midwest. We will pay special attention to treatments of the US-Dakota War of 1862, forced cultural assimilation of indigenous children via boarding schools, and forms of support and justice available to indigenous people in Minnesota today. The course will culminate in students doing a \"deep dive\" into a research topic relating to a local movement or organization identified with indigenous justice."
