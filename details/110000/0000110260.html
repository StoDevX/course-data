<p><b>"Nature" and the Biblical Traditions</b> This section, focused on ecological themes and experiences, considers how different interpretations of the Bible have influenced (positively and negatively) conceptions of responsibility to and for the natural world. What is the relationship between human nature and the "natural" world? How do encounters with wildness and wilderness shape dispositions of gratitude, joy, and wonder? What is the value or significance of the more-than-human world? How should we deliberate about questions of wildlife management, endangered species, wilderness conservation, or climate policies? We will pair close readings of the Bible with selections from the tradition of nature writing, an interdisciplinary exercise which will allow us to address these questions of historical and on-going significance. </p>
