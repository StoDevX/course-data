		"Race concepts historically rely on visual cues, developing out of perceived differences in phenotype. However, non-visual cues such as timbre, volume, language, rhythm, and musical scale frequently bolster existing stereotypes to an extent that sound itself becomes racialized. Students read foundational literature from race and ethnic studies as well as specific case studies in music as a means to consider how people from different times and places have used sound to express or assign racial identity. Prerequisites: Music 241 and 242. WRI pending approval."
