	PHIL 253: Democracy: Rule of the Ignorant?
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> It is a platitude that democracy is a triumph of liberal civilization. Yet critics have charged that democratic citizens are ignorant and ill equipped to understand complex policy issues. This course explores the moral justifications for democracy in light of major objections and investigates whether there is something genuinely virtuous about the kind of society it sustains. Students discuss sources in political philosophy, economics, and political science. Prerequisite: BTS-T or permission of instructor. Offered most years. </p>
