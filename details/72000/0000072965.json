		"This course extends important ideas of single-variable calculus (derivatives, integrals, graphs,",
		"approximation, optimization, fundamental theorems, etc.) to higher-dimensional settings. These",
		"extensions make calculus tools far more powerful in modeling the (multi-dimensional) real world.",
		"Topics include partial derivatives, multiple integrals, transformations, Jacobians, line and",
		"surface integrals, and the fundamental theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. Prerequisites:",
		"Mathematics 126 or 128, and 220.  Offered each semester."
