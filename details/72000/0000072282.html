	ASIAN 210: Asian Conversations I: Mapping Journeys
	(2010-2011, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> How do pilgrims, travelers and migrants make sense of their journeys in Asia? Students explore maps, histories, tales, and guides that define Asia today and in years past, including at least one of the classic Asian texts; study how cultural, linguistic, economic, religious, social, and political connections and divisions create and sustain communities in Asia; spend the last few weeks of the term planning related projects for their interim course. Prerequisite: Chinese 112 or Japanese 112 or permission of instructor. Offered annually in the fall semester. </p>
