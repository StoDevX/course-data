		"Big History examines patterns across vast time scales, from cosmic origins to the present. Students trace the brain's story from the evolution of the simplest nervous systems to hominin brain evolution to contemporary neuroscience. This interdisciplinary course integrates evolutionary biology, history and philosophy of psychology, literature, and the arts to explore how different cultures and eras have conceptualized the brain and mind. Through primary sources, scientific papers, creative works, and computational visualization, students examine the brain from its evolutionary origins to its function as the biological foundation of human culture and society. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125."
