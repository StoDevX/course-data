		"In this course, popular myths, slurs, and mythologies around images of Voodoo religion are examined through histories of the African diaspora and interpretations of religion and cultural contact in Black Atlantic studies. While providing students with a fundamental understanding of African Diaspora Traditions such as Conjure (USA), Vodou (Haiti), Obeah, Kumina, Revival Zion and Rastari (Jamaica), Spiritual Baptist (Tobago), and Yoruba (USA & Cuba), media and film representations of Haitian Vodou and Voodoo in the Lower South are central sites of investigation. Viewing and analyzing horror films such White Zombie (1932) and animated features such as Princess and the Frog (2009), we work toward a historical description of how the making of world religions, race, media & representation, and consumer capitalism shaped the ways audiences in North America have come to think and talk about Voodoo."
