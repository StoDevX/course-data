		"The creators in this class transgress the boundaries of gender, genre, and form. Their works tell womens stories from intersectional perspectives and many emphasize biography, autobiography, or history. However, they also hybridize, mashup, and cross genres and forms. For example, Laura Esquivels <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i> is both a novel and a cookbook while Ntozake Shange describes <i>When the Rainbow Is Enuf</i>, which combines poetry, dance, and music, as a \"choreopoem.\" Students will examine the role of the female writer, director, and artist in texts from across cultures. By analyzing how they defy cultural constructs like genre, form, gender, nation, and race, students will appreciate how the texts reveal and redress cultural differences shaped by power, privilege, and inequality."
