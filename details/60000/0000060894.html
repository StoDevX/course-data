	SOAN 244: Gender Matters at Work
	(2007-2008, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students gain a sociological understanding of gender and work which they can use to understand the larger work world and their own lives and careers. Students explore gender and work in terms of history, current conditions, causes, consequences, and sources of transformation, largely in the United States but also globally. Topics range across domestic labor, unequal pay and promotion, sexual harrassment, survival jobs such as garment assembly, laws, workplace policies, and union organizing. Offered during Interim. </p>
