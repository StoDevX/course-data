	ECON 112: Economics of Sustainability
	(2007-2008, Interim)
	</p>
<p> The unknown fate of billions of people across the world and the environment upon which they depend necessitates novel perspectives to address sustainability as it relates to both population and the environment. This course discusses sustainability from an economics perspective, and in doing so introduces the basic tenets of microeconomics and macroeconomics, such as consumers, producers, markets, welfare, income, and trade. </p>
