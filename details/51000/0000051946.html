	EDUC 382: Human Relations (0)
	(2006-2007, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> All candidates must have a multicultural field experience to help develop their competence in teaching in multicultural environments. A minimum of 80 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment (an Interim or its equivalent) is required prior to student teaching. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: Education 170 (Urban Schools and Communities); Education 347 (Teaching English as a Second Language); Education 378 (Multicultural Education in Hawaii); Education 379 (Urban Education Seminar and Practicum); ACM Interdisciplinary 335 Methods and Materials for Teaching ESL; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools with special cognitive component. See Education Department faculty and web site for advice and information. Education 382 is not a course. Rather it is a recording mechanism indicating St. Olaf students who have completed their multicultural education requirement. Students register for Education 382 during their professional semester. </p>
