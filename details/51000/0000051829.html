	ECON 371: Economics of Public Policy
	(2006-2007, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Government action affects us all. We pay taxes; we use public roads, schools and parks. Some prices we pay are lower due to government subsidies; others are higher due to taxes. Government actions influence both the efficiency of our economy and the equity and equality within our society. Students learn valuable analytical tools for evaluating public projects, tax policies, entitlement programs and voting behavior. Prerequisite: Economics 262, Statistics 263 or Statistics 316, or permission of instructor and completion of BTS-T. </p>
