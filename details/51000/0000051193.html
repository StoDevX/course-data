	(2006-2007, Interim)

<p> This course approaches longstanding questions about the meaning of conflict, violence, and power in human societies from an anthropological perspective. The course examines indigenous traditions of conflict and conviviality and the violence indigenous societies endured in colonial encounters with the West. Students also consider anthropological approaches to modern forms of violence including terrorism, ethnic cleansing, and state violence. Finally, students examine anthropological approaches to the analysis of twenty-first century wars and contemporary peace movements. Offered during Interim. </p>
