	PHYS 127: Analytical Physics II
	(2006-2007, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This three-semester calculus-based sequence leads the student through basic principles that account electrical power distribution systems, stereos, and black holes. It is the starting point for a major in physics and is also appropriate for majors in fields such as chemistry or mathematics who desire more mathematical depth than would be used in the two-semester 124-125 sequence. </p><p> Physics 127 explores special relativity, vibrational motion, waves, fluids, heat, and geometric optics. There is one 2.5-hour laboratory meeting per week. Prerequisites: Physics 126 or permission of instructor, and concurrent registration in (or previous completion of) Mathematics 126 or 128. </p>
