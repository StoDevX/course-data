	REL 244B: The Death of God: Reason, Cross, and Theology
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The death of God refers to both the absence of God in a post-Christian culture and the death of Jesus on the cross. These two meanings have a significance for the religious and non-religious alike. Students evaluate the challenges that the death of God has for the concept of God, the meaning and purpose of Jesus, religious belief, reason, and the secular by reading classical and contemporary theological work on the death of Jesus and the death of God. Prerequisite: BTS-B. Offered alternate years. </p>
