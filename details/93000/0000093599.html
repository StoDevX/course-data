	PSYCH 393: Seminar: Psychology of India
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The primary goal in this course is to explore the potential that Indian psychology and cultural perspectives hold for promoting understanding, health, and well-being when incorporated into western frameworks. Indian psychology today is a unique integration of science with spirituality, deeply rooted in an ancient culture and profound philosophy that seeks insight into human consciousness. Theories and practices from Indian classical thought have contemporary relevance to modern psychology and hold the potential to complement and enrich modern science in content, theory-construction, practical applications, and basic research methodology. Prerequisites: Psychology 230 or permission of instructor. </p>
