	ECON 372: Behavioral Economics
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Classic economics assumes that people make decisions rationally. Behaviorial economics weakens that assumption, incorporating the findings of psychology into economic models. Students learn to apply behaviorial economics theories to improve their understanding of business, marketing, public policy, and other domains of economics. Students utilize skills they have learned from microeconomic theory and statistics orally and in writing. Prerequisites: Economics 262 and Statistics 263 or Statistics 272, or permission of the instructor. </p>
