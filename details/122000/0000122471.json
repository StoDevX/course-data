		"Fascination with Napoleon has produced myriad interpretations of him and his historical significance.  Was he a genius or did he \"blunder to glory\"?  Was he the savior of the French Revolution or the first modern dictator?  Did he reorganize the Continent as a conqueror or as the first modern European?  Students use speeches, letters, and memoirs (his own, his supporters', his critics'); paintings and caricature (including his own propaganda); literature; state documents; and films to investigate the historical and the mythical Napoleon and explore how later generations (re)invent interpretations of the man."
