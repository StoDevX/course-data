	ENVST 281: Topics in Environmental Studies
	(2013-2014, Summer Session 1)
	</p>
<p> EnvSt 281 Sustainability in Higher Education ( ) Â– Paul Jackson Your student government committee recently proposed placing greater emphasis on sustainability at your university. A surprising response comes from a fellow student, "Just what do you mean by sustainability and how do you measure it?" In this class students examine the diverse approaches to sustainability across baccalaureate liberal arts institutions, and their understanding of sustainability as an expression of institutional identity, institutional and environmental based values, operating principles, metrics, and reported outcomes. Students explore the parallels, opportunities, and constraints present in the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS), and in the Minnesota Green Step Cities Program. The context of Northfield, Minnesota, home to two baccalaureate liberal arts institutions and a Green Step City participant, provides an opportunity to explore local practice and decision-making. </p>
