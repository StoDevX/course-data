	BIO 266: Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> What happened to the dinosaurs? Can some human congenital heart defects be explained by reference to cardiovascular systems of diving turtles? Examining the origin and evolution of vertebrates, comparing morphology across vertebrate taxa and examining selective factors leading to modern forms is of value to health science students, graduate studies in biology, and people who like dinosaurs. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Counts as "comparative organismal biology" core category. Prerequisites: BIO 150 or BIO126. </p>
