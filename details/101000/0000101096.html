	ENVST 281: Topics in Environmental Studies
	(2015-2016, Interim)
	</p>
<p>In this course students develop critical viewing and practical video-making skills as they explore the aesthetic, rhetorical, and expressive potential of documentary films to positively impact our environment. We study a variety of documentaries and their ties to the main genres within nonfiction (including Direct Cinema, Cinema Verite, and the Essay Film) and examine how these works construct meaning and influence society. Concurrently, the course introduces students to the basics of video production, building the technical and conceptual skills that budding practitioners need to translate ideas into video format. Focusing specifically on the critical analysis of works that address <i>environmental sustainability</i> and <i>human consumption</i>, the course is comprised of readings, film screenings, discussions, technical demos, and the production of a collaborative short documentary where students convey their own observations, hopes, and concerns on the subject. </p>
