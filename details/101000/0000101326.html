	REL 121N: Bible in Culture and Community
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>THE BIBLE IN THE AGE OF FERGUSON: The shooting of an unarmed 18 year-old black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, MO, August 9th, 2014, by white police officer Darren Wilson re-sparked nationwide conversations about race in the U.S. Questions about systemic racial injustice, policing, white privilege, and culture entered the public in ways both old and new, from protests invoking Hands up, Dont shoot to the Black Lives Matter movement. This section of 121 takes these current conversations about race and racial injustice as a starting point. We will work through contemporary cultural biblical studies and engage contemporary critical race theory along the way. Alongside biblical texts, well read poets like Claudia Rankine and her prophetic lyric Citizen, Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me, womanist scholarship like Kelly Brown Douglas' Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God, and theologian James Cones most recent work, The Cross and the Lynching Tree. </p>
