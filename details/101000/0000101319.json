		"JOURNEYS AND THE BIBLE: TRAVEL AND TRANSFORMATION.  This section focuses on geographical movements in the Bible, for instance, exodus, exile, diaspora, and the journeys of Jesus and Paul, and their relationships to religious meaning.  Journey is also a metaphor for inward change and spiritual development, and we will also look at the ways the Bible depicts such changes. The course also examines recent literary narratives that depict travel and transformation."
