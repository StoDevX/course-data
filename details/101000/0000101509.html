	WRIT 111C: First-Year Writing
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>PERSONAL ECOLOGY. How have you been shaped by the natural places you know best? This seminar will focus on writers and filmmakers who narrate a personal experience with nature. We will read and discuss works in a range of genres, including creative nonfiction, memoir, ethnography, and documentary film. We will ask how individual and community identities are formed by interaction with nature, how cultures define nature differently, and how we can understand ourselves as participants in ecological systems that include living things, land, water, and air. Students will work on the process of writing, with short pieces culminating in a final research paper in which you further investigate a natural place you have experienced and write about its meaning for you. </p>
