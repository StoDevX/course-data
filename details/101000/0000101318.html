<p>GENDER IMAGININGS. Debates about the Bibles role in defining male and female as well as the marital, sexual and social roles that flow out of gender are a lively part of contemporary culture. This section will think about the Bible in relationship to such debates. In particular, two questions will inform our conversations: 1) How is gender presented within the biblical world? 2) How does the Bible shape how we imagine gender? In order to ask these questions, we will examine a variety of ways contemporary thinkers understand gender within the biblical canon, ideas about the moral and social authority of the Bible and how the Bible is employed within contemporary debates about gender. </p>
