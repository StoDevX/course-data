		"Do scientific advances happen because of superior evidence? The surprising reality is that scientific progress can be far less scientific than one might expect. While the scientific process gives us tools to better understand our world, the acceptance and broader integration of these findings is often anything but scientific. In this course, we will examine some key developments in modern science (such as the Copernican Revolution in Physics and Astronomy, the Darwinian revolution in Biology and the Cognitive Counter-Revolution In Psychology) to better understand how scientific progress is made. We will discuss how past scientific findings became accepted as the status quo, and how we go about challenging that status quo when new evidence comes to light. In this class we will read primary texts and discuss key events in science to understand that scientific progress evolves in rational and irrational ways."
