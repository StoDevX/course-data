		"This course examines the intersecting and changing relationships among film, media, and the environment. It poses the following questions: How have film and media industries affected the environment? How have particular films and media products influenced discussions around urgent environmental topics, such as climate change? Moreover, how do some theorists view environmental elements (such as, plants, trees, etc.) as forms of media? Students will acquire knowledge of film and media terminology during the course, and is not a prerequisite."
