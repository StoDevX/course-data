<p> This seminar explores research on mental imagery and visual perception, focusing on the use of imagery in thinking.

Students also research mental conceptions as represented in dance notation, pictorial instructions, and scientific images. Prerequisites: Psychology 230, plus 235 or 237 or permission of instructor. Offered most years. </p>
