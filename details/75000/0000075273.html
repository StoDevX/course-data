	BIO 341: Cell Physiology
	(2010-2011, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The cell is the fundamental unit of life, capable of growth, motility, signal transduction, and functional specialization. Students study features common to cells: their macromolecular components, metabolism, membrane transport, motility, signal mechanisms, and intracellular trafficking, seeing how these are elaborated in cells with particular specializations. Research techniques suitable for cell physiology are emphasized. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 125, 126, and 233 plus Chemistry 125 and 126, or Chemistry/Biology 125-127 and Biology 126 and 233. </p>
