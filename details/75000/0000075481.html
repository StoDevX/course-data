	ART 271: Gothic Art
	(2010-2011, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course treats both the art created in the Gothic period in Western Europe (c. 1140-1400) and the revival of the Gothic style in 19th-century Europe. In the later medieval world, the course focuses on the rise of the city, on the spirituality of the Franciscan and Dominican orders, and on a new class of patrons who, fueled by the new economy of Europe, commissioned art on a larger scale than ever before. The course ends with a discussion of what the Gothic came to mean in the 19th century, as European nations solidified and industrialized. Offered every three years. </p>
