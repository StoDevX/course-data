	PHIL 247: Selected Topics in Philosophy
	(2010-2011, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course is concerned with the dominant school of philosophy in late antiquity (200-600 AD), a pivotal time in the history of philosophy that bridges the gap between ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and medieval Jewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophy. Herein we will study the works of Plotinus, the so-called founder of Neoplatonism, and three prominent Neoplatonists who succeeded him, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus. Completion of Phil 235 or Greek 372 is recommended. </p>
