	(2005-2006, Interim)
	</p>
<p> In this Interim course students who have completed the Asian Conversations sequence travel to sites in China and Japan in order to experience those cultures firsthand and to study Chinese and Japanese constructions of national identity. Through readings, site visits, interactions with peers in the target languages, homestays and journal writing in both English and their target language, students learn about how Asians in these two countries perceive themselves and their role in the region and in the world, both in the past and in the present. They travel to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Nagasaki and Tokyo. Prerequisite: Asian Studies 211 or permission of the instructor. </p>
