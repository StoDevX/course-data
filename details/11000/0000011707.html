	ASIAN 270: Visual Culture of Modern China
	(2005-2006, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course highlights major visual arts movements within China over the last century, from the end of the imperial era to current times. We look at a variety of issues: class and gender; China in the world art market; Chinese art past and present; and a variety of "isms" now seen as defining Chinese art. A major theme is to define visual culture in all its nuances. </p>
