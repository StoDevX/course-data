	REL 259: Religion and Culture in Rome (abroad)
	(2005-2006, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course traces the influences of religion in Rome as it was gradually transformed from the capital city of a pagan empire into the administrative center of Catholic Christianity. Students conduct a selective comparison of ancient, medieval, renaissance, baroque and modern religion through visits to historical sites, churches, museums and contemporary cultural events in Rome -- and to other Italian cities which interacted with Rome. Offered in Interim, 2001-02. </p>
