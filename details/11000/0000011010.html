	REL 233B: God and Faith in Autobiography
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This course focuses on autobiographical texts in which the writer describes his or her life in relationship to God. The course is based on the central Christian theological belief that God is known in historical experience. We study the different ways in which Christians have sought to understand Gods role in their lives by correlating their own experiences with the classic beliefs, symbols and values of the Christian faith. </p>
