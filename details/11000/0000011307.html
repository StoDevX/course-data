	ART 255: Italian Art in Context (abroad)
	(2005-2006, Interim)
	</p>
<p> There is no substitute for direct, personal experience. In Italy, students study Renaissance and Medieval paintings, sculptures and buildings in context. Students examine the works that went before the Renaissance and the ones which came afterwards to work out for themselves what made Italian art special and what value it has for us today. </p>
