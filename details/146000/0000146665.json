		"How does attending college affect students?  This seminar will consider emerging adulthood development in the context of higher education, developmental trajectories of college students, and theories of change.  We will examine research on college impact, ways of measuring that impact, and how individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity, SES, religion/worldview, academic ability) influence development.  Students will engage in individual reflection on their college experiences, and identify ways of promoting optimal development during the college years.  Prerequisites:  PSYCH 230 and PSYCH 241 or permission of instructor."
