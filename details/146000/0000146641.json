		"This course seeks to provide a broad understanding about the role law has played in the history and society of North America and the United States from late colonial times into the twenty-first century. The course will focus on intersections of legal history with such themes as race, class, gender and sexuality, citizenship, and empire. Over the course of the semester, students will engage with historiography and analyze historical documents to uncover not only how people think of and create law, but how law has historically shaped our social realities. This course seeks to analyze \"what law does\" and why it is a fundamental part of our daily lives."
