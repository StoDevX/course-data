		"This course investigates the place of women, girls, and all who identify as female in sport, exercise, and wellness from a socio-cultural vantage provided by the fields of the anthropology of sport, the sociology of sport, feminism, and body studies. Female participation in wellness and physical culture has not come without struggle into arenas strongly marked by male hegemony. While human participation in sport has been documented since ancient times, it is only in the last 50 years that female participation has garnered attention, asking us to rethink many assumptions about the the human body, cultural constructions of power such as competition and aggression, gender, race, class, age, ability, and our place in the ecology and evolution of this planet."
