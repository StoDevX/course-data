		"On January 6, 2021, President Trump inspired a failed insurrectionist attempt. The attempt is unjustifiable, but it raises the question: Is there such a thing as a just insurrection? If the liberationist strategy of insurrection almost always fails, is it unjustifiable to violently resist oneÂ’s oppressor, even if this is the only viable path to liberation? How would philosophical theorizing (say, ethics and political philosophy) change if it had to start from the premise of oppression rather than a premise of freedom? How does an abolitionist perspective (rather than a gradualist perspective) change how we think about contemporary justice issues--e.g., responsibility for implicit bias or prison reform? Who are the philosophers theorizing the liberationist strategies and virtues necessary to overcome oppression? What do they have to say about these issues, the current state of professional philosophy, and the power dynamics that limit philosophical thinking? In addition to considering these questions, we will consider liberationist perspectives on racism and antiracism, the relationship of Black Lives Matter to the Black Power movement, the ongoing controversy over Critical Race Theory, and whether it is possible or desirable to study oppressed groups without keeping score about which groups suffer most. This course satisfies the Expanding Perspectives distribution requirement for the philosophy major."
