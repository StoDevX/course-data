		"Philosophers have increasingly come to recognize the role that social factors play in the production of knowledge, including scientific knowledge. The rise of social media and internet-driven misinformation and polarization have highlighted just how much social networks shape the information we acquire and the beliefs we form. This course will consider social and political issues in epistemology (the study of knowledge and justified belief). It will focus on the role of social factors in the production, dissemination, and uptake of scientific knowledge and misinformation. Questions addressed include: Who are the right experts, and how do we tell? What role does trust play in science? What special epistemic issues arise in the context of the internet and social media? What problems does democracy pose for making the best use of scientific knowledge? Prerequisites: two courses in philosophy, one of which must be either PHIL 235 or PHIL 236, or permission of the department chair."
