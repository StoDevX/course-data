		"This course introduces the history of U.S. foreign relations from the founding of the Republic through the Cold War. How has the United States interacted with the world across time and space? How did what started as a collection of rebellious British colonies eventually coalesce into a global superpower? How have Americans understood the United States' changing global roles? We will explore themes such as war making; state and nation-building; empire, colonialism, and territorial expansion; the nature of national power; the role of race and gender; concepts of civilization; and economic growth and market economics to develop a broad understanding of U.S. foreign relations. We will look at how U.S. actions have affected and changed the wider world and examine how interactions with people, places, events, and ideas defined as \"foreign\" have transformed American life."
