		"What was natural philosophy? How was it that the sciences and the humanities were once viewed as a shared endeavor, but are now treated as separate? In the Romantic period (ca. 1750-1850), natural scientists were still considered philosophers, and poets and novelists like Mary Shelley first asked critical social and ethical questions about the consequences of scientific breakthroughs (such as in the novel Frankenstein, which we will read). The focal point of this course will be the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered electromagnetism in 1820, and mentored the other Hans Christian, the fairytale author Andersen. After improving their academic reading, writing, and research skills, students, for their class project, will work together to create a display about Ørsted at the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis."
