		"The desire for freedom motivates social justice movements, spiritual renewal and individual rebellion against or suspicion of authority figures. Some religions promise it, others presuppose it. Freedom lies at the heart of many ethical systems. The intellectual challenge raised by freedom lies in saying what it is, what makes it valuable, and how to get it if you lack it. This seminar examines attempts to answer these questions by philosophers and political theorists, religious leaders, abolitionists, revolutionaries and others through the ages and in a variety of social and cultural settings."
