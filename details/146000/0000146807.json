		"Many people consider the Nordic welfare models exemplary for their promises of equality and well-being for all, but history shows that Nordic countries have not always treated people with disabilities well. This seminar examines experiences of and responses to disability in the Nordic region and how disability intersects with other markers of diversity such as race, gender, age, and class. We will ask how we might reimagine the different experiences of people with disabilities as an element of a diverse, equitable society by exploring the representations of people with disabilities in literature, film, art, journalism, and popular culture. Through reading, discussion, writing, and research, we will question how our concepts of bodymind normalcy shape our own understanding of ability and disability."
