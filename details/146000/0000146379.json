		"We've much to learn from the witches of the past. Not, of course, how to curse our enemies or brew love potions. Instead, witchcraft and magic are components of the supernatural that will help us understand cultures of the past (including the recent past), and the people who produced them. We'll learn about what the alleged witches thought of themselves, and how magic helped them (and those around them) understand their world. While magic and witchcraft have had some place in human societies for millenia (and still today!), those presumed to wield that power have been accepted or rejected to varying degrees. Accusations of witchcraft, moreover, have also historically been employed to rob others of power. As we will discover in this course, witchcraft and magic are implicated in social, economic, and political histories, and are heavily tied into gender construction and the history of women."
