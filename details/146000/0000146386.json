		"This course examines the \"History\" of the Holocaust, and on ways the Holocaust has been remembered. We pay particular attention to Germany's development of a \"Racial State\" which defined who was and was not part of the Volk, and the legal, social, and economic steps the state took to exclude and persecute a range of the \"racially inferior\"--Jews, but also the Roma and Scintii, people with developmental and physical disabilities, homosexuals, Slavs, and others. After we've gained an overview of the Holocaust, its victims, its perpetrators, and its bystanders, we will explore the ways that the Holocaust has been memorialized, historicized, and fictionalized."
