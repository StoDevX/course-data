		"This course is built around one question in global history and current events: why do some countries or regions seem poor while others seem rich? With a focus on the history of specific social groups -- of peasants, workers, women and intellectuals -- we will examine the history of colonialism in the Global South, ask what decolonization meant for people across the region, and conclude by exploring the core contemporary issues facing the Global South and the rest of the world."
