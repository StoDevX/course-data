		"This course examines the development of theories of deviance, violence, and crime in East Asia from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We cover topics such as the development of forensic science, court systems, police forces, and prison systems; the evolution of academic and practical fields related to deviance, including criminology, penology, eugenics, and psychology; and the global shift from corporal punishment to rehabilitative-minded custodial sentencing. Although these shifts in theories and approaches to crime were part of a global process, for twentieth-century East Asian nation-states they were particularly informed by the violence of Western imperialism and the struggle for sovereignty. Students examine how desires for building a modern nation-state influenced these conversations on crime and punishment, as well as how these punitive projects intersected with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality, often resulting in the incarceration of marginalized groups."
