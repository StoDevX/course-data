		"This first-year seminar introduces students to the field of Cultural Studies by examining how the social, political, and cultural upheavals of the 1960s -- one of the most influential decades in American history -- intersected with the popular music of the time. We will examine the music, lyrics, and visual and film representations of an array of 1960s musical artists in rock, pop, soul, and folk, from Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin to The Beatles, Bob Dylan and others. We will also trace the relationships between popular music and the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, anti-Vietnam War activism, women's rights, the sexual revolution and the rise of the drug culture. The semester will culminate in a group project in which students will research, analyze, and present their work on the cultural significance of a musical artist or genre."
