		"By exploring social, cultural, and medical ideas about human sexuality as well as sexual cultures and practices in Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas, we will examine how the study of sexuality alters our understanding of history and the human experience. Sex is more than the sum of its parts. It is pleasure and pain, but it is also a language for categorization, a tool for control, and a site of fear and anxiety. Experiences and ideas about sex were shaped by systemic racism and white supremacy, imperialism, institutional and domestic violence, and political upheaval. We'll focus on sexual practices and identities from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, to better understand sex and sexuality in our own world."
