		"In this course, students will analyze graphic novels and other visual narratives (graphic memoirs, journalism, and history, for example) through a literary lens to interrogate the possibilities, and limitations, of visual storytelling. In addition to examining the form of the assigned works, students will consider questions of audience and global representation in crafting graphic narratives. Which creators can, or should, represent whose stories, both visually and textually? Do images make graphic novels more widely understood than a strictly textual work? This course equips students with the requisite analytical skills to raise these questions and others about graphic narratives in global contexts. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
