		"This course centers the perspectives and experiences of women writers as a gateway into American literature. From the early days of the Revolution to the twenty-first century, American women have used fiction, memoir, and poetry, among other genres, to shape cultural discourse and advocate for social or political change. We will read a range of these authors, including racially diverse writers from both mainstream and underrepresented communities. Some major themes will include the American marriage market, forms of family and motherhood, slavery and its legacies, immigration, and intercultural encounters."
