		"Installation art today is a widespread and diverse practice. In a Euro-American context, its origins and development are often linked to movements like minimalism, conceptual art, site-specificity, video, and performance. However, this narrative risks oversimplifying the evolution of installation art in non-Western settings and perpetuating Eurocentric views. This course adopts a cross-cultural and multi-regional approach to examine the histories of installation art. We will explore the fluid and genre-crossing nature of installation art by addressing key questions: How is installation art shaped and redefined within broader social, political, and cultural contexts? What roles do time and space play in the experience of installation art? And how do immersive installations alter our bodily and sensory engagement with a work?"
