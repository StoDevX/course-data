	BIO 387: Neuroethology
	(2006-2007, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Neuroethology is the study of how nervous systems generate natural behaviors in animals. The nervous system interfaces an animal with its environment, determining how an animal perceives, learns, and reacts to stimuli. This course explores the neural mechanisms underlying diverse behaviors - such as escape reflexes, locomotion, and communication - in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species. Lecture concepts are unpacked through laboratory experimentation and student presentation. Prerequisites: Math 120 (or equivalent) and one of the following: Biology 233, 247, 266, Neuroscience 234, or Psychology 238 or permission of the instructor. </p>
