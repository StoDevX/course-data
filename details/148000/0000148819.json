		"Using \"guerrilla-style\" filmmaking tactics, this class focuses on bringing formal structure to videos in ways that create satisfying stories--both  fictitious and documentary--while giving students background on how to  best utilize their lens, editing skills, as well as sound and visual effects to help bring out their stories. These experiences prepare students to make their own low-budget short films."
