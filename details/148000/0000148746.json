		"This literature class traces an arc from the politically engaged writing of the Black Arts Movement (BAM) in the 1960s and 70s to the present early 21st-century moment, which has been seen as both a renaissance for Black literature as well as a significant time of racial reckoning. Students read poetry, plays, essays, and manifestos by BAM and contemporary authors and explore the relationships between literature and jazz, hip-hop, and visual media. Literary analysis essays and a final project provide opportunities to investigate the intersections of identity, politics, and aesthetics and to explore ways that literature can confront racism and shape social change."
