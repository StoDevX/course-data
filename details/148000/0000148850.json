		"In this interdisciplinary writing course, students respond to visual art, music, film/TV, and dance, not only writing about these art forms but also translating their formal qualities into writing (e.g., writing as riff, montage, or tango). By exploring literatureÂ’s relationship to the other arts and studying the work of artists and writers working across disciplines, students examine how artistic vision is shaped and gain a more capacious sense of the possibilities of language. Self-directed excursions, peer workshops, and in-class writing exercises spark new approaches to the creative process. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
