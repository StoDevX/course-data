		"Students engage in the physical practice and theory of Bartenieff Fundamentals, part of Laban Movement Analysis. Students increase body/mind awareness and body connectivity through mindful practice of physical exercises, supported by some reading and reflective personal assessments. The movement practice focuses on breath and core engagement through rhythmic repetition in subtle, simple, and complex movements on the floor, at mid-level, and standing. This course includes repertoire developed to help improve key dance specified areas and is appropriate for all populations and levels of fitness. May be repeated. P/N only."
