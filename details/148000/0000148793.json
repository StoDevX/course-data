		"This 200-level course will explore the history and legacy of the Cold War, a global conflict that was and is as much a contest of geopolitical power and influence as it is a battle waged in the circulation or suppression of ideas, beliefs, culture, propaganda, and misinformation. From the Russian Revolution in 1917 through World War II, the War in Vietnam and beyond, we will explore crucial moments when media and misinformation have been leveraged by governments, the press, and the culture industry to shape public opinion, to influence the democratic process, and to manufacture political consensus or social division at home and abroad."
