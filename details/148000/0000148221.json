		"This course will explore the morality of justice, punishment, and equity through the lens of class, gender, and race. By looking at the constructed nature of justice, different kinds of justice, including restorative, environmental, redistributive, we will explore the question of justice across the world. Topics will include: how do we determine what is fair punishment? How can we ensure equity in an unequal world? Can justice be equal? How do concepts such as human rights, discrimination, and racism affect justice and punishment in society?"
