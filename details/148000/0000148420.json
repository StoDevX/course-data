		"Students explore West African dance genres that embody a strong rhythmic foundation. They experience rhythmic patterns as an organizing principle for the human body, an expressive capacity, and a social connector. Students investigate the cultural and social milieu from which dance genres emerge. These classes represent a broad perspective on dance forms that, in their evolution, have intersected and created a matrix of different philosophies and aesthetic approaches. This class will provide students experience with selected dances, styles and techniques as movement practices that embody an aspect of African culture and history. In this introductory course, students will be introduced to two dances from West Africa that they will study in some depth: they are Kpanlogo and Gota."
