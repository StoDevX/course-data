		"Where do monsters come from and what do they want? What kinds of sociocultural, economic, and other vital critiques does the monstrous offer? In this course, students examine what historical conditions have given rise to monsters like vampires, zombies, and other blood-thirsty creatures, and theorize on why monsters seem to (un)naturally (re)adapt to our ever-changing ways of life. By considering myths from around the world, students trace the roots of these monsters and locate contexts where these monsters have found newer homes and renewed relevance. But monsters are hardly phenomena solely tied to the past: they also lurk in the future, in the unknown, in how the \"normal\" is constructed. The course puts monsters into conversation with anxieties around race, glass, gender, indigeneity versus foreignness, immigration, illness, disability, technology, political ideologies, and much more. After this course, students will never see monsters the same way again."
