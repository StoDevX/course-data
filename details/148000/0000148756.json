		"This course examines the process of colonization in North America, emphasizing interactions between Indigenous, European, and African-descended peoples. We begin with an examination of Native American communities as they existed before the European invasions, and their creative responses to European colonization during two centuries of contact. Alongside European-Native affairs, the course devotes equal attention to the development of the transatlantic slave trade, plantation systems in the southern colonies, and the emergence of African-American culture that formed in response to these historical experiences. Additional topics include imperial rivalry and warfare, and comparative colonial and gender systems. Students gain valuable self-initiated research experience utilizing primary sources and major historiographical works."
