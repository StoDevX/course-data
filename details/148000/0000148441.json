		"Intermediate West African Dance is a continuation of the exploration of Beginners West African dance through kinesthetic engagement and selected philosophical and aesthetic perspectives. This course will explore selected dances and their associated cultural functions to enter an embodied dialogue in African Diasporic dance. Primary focus will be placed on dances from West Africa. Many dances from these countries have gained exposure in the West through National Dance Company tours, and dancers from these companies have relocated to the States and teach the repertory of their national dances."
