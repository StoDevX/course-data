		"For centuries, Latin America has been a crucial site in the growth of global capitalism, with profound consequences for the way that the regionÂ’s peoples have related to their ecologies. This course examines the history of capitalist development and expansion in the region from the dawn of colonial rule to the turn of the twenty-first century. Students will conceptualize and execute a substantial research project into the ecological history of capitalism in Latin America, thus establishing a working knowledge of Latin American history, as well as familiarity with some of the key questions, debates and methods in environmental history."
