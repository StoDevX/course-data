		"This course explores the history of prosperity, privation, and peril that the U.S. experienced from 1920 to 1940. Between the 20th centurys two World Wars, Americans encountered economic expansion, widening inequality, and the Great Depression. Using secondary sources and primary sources--ranging from photographs and film to oral histories and government statistics--students investigate controversies over immigration, gender roles, youth, Prohibition, New Deal policy, labor, and race. Students focus on how historians use and interpret different types of primary sources to create and complicate narratives about this period, asking also how histories of the 1920s and 1930s shape our understanding of todays world."
