		"Coined by Mark Dery in \"Black to the Future\" (1994), the concept of <i>Afrofuturism</i> has its roots in the Middle Passage, as enslaved Africans yearned for a future free of bondage and oppression. Since the time of their kidnapping, African diasporic peoples have been dreaming of a future, a world, in which they are able to define and determine for themselves who they are and how they live, unencumbered by the various -isms in society. These \"worlds\" that have been created in the imaginations of African diasporic artists have led to a genre and cultural aesthetic known as Afrofuturism. This course provides an introduction to this genre and aesthetic that engages with key works of literature, music, film, and art that have defined and shaped Afrofuturism. Students leave the class with a better understanding of what Afrofuturism is, why it's significant, and the role they can play in shaping a world where Black people are free."
