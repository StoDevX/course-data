		"The poet Lucille Clifton calls us in with these words from her poem \"won't you celebrate with me\": <i>come celebrate / with me that everyday / something has tried to kill me / and has failed</i>. This course is an invitation for you to engage, learn from, and marinate in the teachings, visions, and wisdom of women of color who have done just that: Survived. Lived. Loved. This course honors and celebrates the literary and theoretical contributions made by Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Mixed, and Trans women, as students analyze their writings through theoretical frameworks (e.g., women of color feminism) conceived and authored by women of color. In so doing, they not only leave with a greater appreciation and reverence for the women of color in their lives but also tap into the vision of collective liberation that binds these women warriors together."
