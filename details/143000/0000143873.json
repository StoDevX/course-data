		"In this course, we'll think about all kinds of games, including board games, card games, playground games, sports, and video games. We will consider why we find ourselves playing games when we have so many other things to do and how they might be able to help us be more successful in navigating the college experience. We'll research and write about communities formed around games, and we'll finish the term by reflecting on what we've learned and applying that knowledge to design a game intended to improve the success of St. Olaf students."
