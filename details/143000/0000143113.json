		"existence: Why are we here? How should we live? Why is there suffering and evil? What happens when",
		"we die? The course alternates between close readings of central religious texts which probe",
		"such questions (including the Jewish Scriptures, the New Testament, and later theologians and",
		"philosophers) and films that take up the questions, as well.  While the central focus is on",
		"Christian and Jewish sources, the course also considers non-theistic perspectives. Through",
		"analysis and discussion of both text and film, students begin to form their own answers."
