		"How are meanings made? How do meanings emerge from making and doing, as well as from seeing and listening, thinking and feeling, and even just being in the same place at the same time? This seminar takes up these fundamental questions, primarily in relation to materials drawn from visual art, poetry, theater, film, and music. It also attends to other ways in which people engage in meaning making, individually and collectively, whether these emerge in everyday life or result from the sustained effort of many people over many years. Throughout the course, creative exercises, creative activities, and creative projects--individual projects and group projects--provide students with opportunities to explore and apply what they have learned about meaning making."
