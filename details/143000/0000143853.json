		"The word \"utopia\" means both a \"good place\" and \"no place.\" Utopian literature embraces this duality by imagining places better than our own. This course will begin with these literary utopias before considering some of the historical attempts to make a \"good place\" in a real place and time. We'll investigate the common problems that both real and imagined utopias have tried to solve, and we'll seek to understand the roots of these problems. We'll end the semester with a collaborative class project to create a utopian college community. Writing for the course will emphasize research, analysis, argumentation, and reflection."
