	"description": [
		"This seminar-style, discussion-based course takes a comparative and intersectional approach to the study of race, gender, class, sexuality, colonialism, and indigeneity. In centering the epistemologies of Indigenous peoples (in the Americas and abroad), this course seeks to challenge (settler) colonialist ways of knowing and understanding in an effort to develop our ability to see through \"Indigenous eyes.\" The goal of the course is to develop and deepen our understanding of decolonizing methodologies and practices in order to decolonize our history, our institutions, our relationships, and ourselves. This course is interdisciplinary, drawing on critical readings and texts from various disciplines."
