		"Travel is simply defined as going from one place to another, but we commonly restrict its meaning to the description of a physical event. A more expansive idea of travel might point us in the direction of literature and film, and the manner in which they position readers/spectators to travel outside of themselves, or to take in and identify with places and perspectives they have never actually experienced. This seminar asks what it means to travel, including but also moving beyond the physical act, to examine how our understanding of it is transformed in an increasingly connected (and disconnected) virtual world. We will read travel literature and screen films that focus on travel, but we will also more broadly consider the promise of travel embedded in these forms themselves."
