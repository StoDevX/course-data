		"Where does democracy come from? What does it take to sustain it? Why does it matter? This class will explore ideas, practices and processes about democracy globally. We will compare and contrast ideas from ordinary people and social scientists as we seek to answer each of these questions. Our focus extends around the world. We will watch documentaries, read two books (Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics: How the Internet Era is Transforming Politics in Kenya and Why Bother? Rethinking Participation in Elections and Protests) and explore data from the Varieties of Democracy project, based in Sweden. The culminating class project involves mapping several dimensions of democracy using ArcGIS StoryMap software, to help us see how it is imagined and realized today."
