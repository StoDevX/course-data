		"The popularity of science fiction stems not only from its speculations about the future, but also from what it tells us about the present. In this seminar we will explore the temporal fluidity of science fiction along with many of its other generic features, including plots, settings, characters, ideological perspectives and explanations of science and technology. We will read sci-fi novels and short stories in addition to watching a selection of sci-fi film classics.  Finally, you will read scholarly texts on both specific works and the genre as a whole."
