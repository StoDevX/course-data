		"In her 2009 TEDTalk \"The Danger of a Single Story,\" novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie states that we often learn about a topic from one point of view. While that one perspective isn't necessarily bad, it limits our understanding of the topic and, more importantly, of the world as well. In this seminar, we will analyze the idea of the \"single story.\" We'll start by interrogating the single stories we're familiar with in our cultural contexts, academic experiences, and personal lives. Who creates these stories? Why do they do so? How do these narratives take root? We will then seek out works that challenge these master narratives by addressing the same topic from another angle: a different author's perspective, a different discipline's approach, or a different culture's beliefs, to name a few. As we dismantle the idea of a \"single story,\" we will read many narratives, and write our own, and explore a complex, vibrant collection of stories."
