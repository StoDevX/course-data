		"Habits make up a large part of our daily lives -- the estimates range from 40% to a whopping 90%. Your habits contribute to your happiness, your mental and physical health, and your GPA. Some habits are considered good, some are bad, some simply are, and an ever-growing number of apps have been created to help you track all of these habits. In this seminar we'll explore the science of learning and habit creation, how stress, sleep and health are directly connected, and how harnessing the power of cues can help create habits that can improve your life, for the rest of your life. Course work will include reading, discussion, and an individual behavioral assessment project."
