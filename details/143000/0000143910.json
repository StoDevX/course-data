		"How do magic, spirituality, myth, the occult, and the paranormal inform our understanding of race and identity? How do artists bring these supernatural elements to material life on stage and screen to facilitate critical conversations about power? This course invites students to engage in deep and nuanced discussion about culture, belief, and imagination, while also learning how artists render critical thinking about race into creative work. Our emphasis will be on reading plays, but we will also look at pop culture like film, music videos, and current TV shows like Lovecraft Country and Reservation Dogs. Authors studied include August Wilson, Marie Clements, Sharon Bridgforth, Aishah Rahman, Manjula Padmanabhan, and Jos√© Rivera.  Students will lead presentations and class discussions, develop research materials around course texts, and stage theatrical magic themselves!"
