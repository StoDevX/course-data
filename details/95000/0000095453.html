	ENGL 264: Topics in Gender and Literature
	(2014-2015, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course investigates how literature--broadly writ--represents both gender diversity and conformity, and the issues associated with gender, such as family, power dynamics, oppression, activism, domesticity, hierarchies, and inequalities. The texts focus on a diversity of gendered identities by complicating the gender binary of "man" and "woman." A consideration of gender separated from other identities is limiting; therefore, this course examines how gender intersects with race, class, ability, sexual orientation, technology, religion, and/or nationality. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term. </p>
