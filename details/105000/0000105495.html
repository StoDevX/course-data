	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p><b>Exploring and Re-Imaging Place in the 21st Century.</b> Place is much more than a set of geographic coordinates or physical location. When we talk about feeling out of place or feeling at home, we are invoking discourses regarding culture, race, gender, history, and politics. Place can be the Golden Gate Bridge, a web forum, Middle Earth, Yellowstone National Park, a video game, a shared memory, or a piece of art. Through discussion of literature and scholarly essays, we will examine what place means and how we give meaning to place and vice versa. We will explore the roles technology and a mobile lifestyle play in redefining our environments and how we behave in them. Major assignments may include personal narratives, research-driven profiles on place, reviews, and interactive digital projects that challenge or enhance our perception of particular places. </p>
