		"<b>Comparative Scriptures: The Bible and Other Sacred Texts</b>  What is the place of the Bible in our religiously diverse world?  In this section of Religion 121 we will study the Bibles of Judaism and Christianity together with scriptures of other religious traditions. We will consider the following questions: What is scripture? What kinds of literature are found in scriptures? What kinds of questions do scriptures address? How are scriptures used by religious people around the world? What is the relevance of scripture in the 21st century?  We will carefully read and discuss selections from the Hebrew Bible of Judaism, the Old and New Testaments of Christianity, the QurÂ’an of Islam, the Vedas and other sacred texts of Hinduism, various Buddhist sutras, and Native American stories."
