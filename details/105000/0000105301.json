		"<b>Land, Food and Justice in Biblical Traditions</b>  This section uses food as a lens for understanding the Bible, both in the context of cultures that wrote it, and in the context of contemporary discussions of sustainability.  Because food is prominent in biblical narratives it is a useful interpretative lens.  Biblical prophets make food central in their vindication of the poor and hungry.  Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions.  Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment.  Guided by these considerations, we will address four main themes involving food and biblical traditions: (1) distributive food justice; (2) food production and care of the land; (3) food and just treatment of animals; and (4) food choices as religiously meaningful."
