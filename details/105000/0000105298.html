	REL 121I: Bible in Culture and Community
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p><b>Abraham's Children</b> Daily news reports regarding violence between Jews, Christians, and Muslims make it difficult to remember that these religions share common roots. Yet, all three trace their lineage back to Abraham. This section explores the common roots of these religions by introducing students to the Bible and the QurÂ’an, and examining their parallel characters and narratives. At the same time, distinctive beliefs and practices of each religion that are grounded in scripture will be investigated to better understand what makes each religious tradition unique. In our pluralistic world, a basic understanding of the relationship between these three monotheistic religions may be more valuable now than ever before. </p>
