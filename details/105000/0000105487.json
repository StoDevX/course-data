		"<b>Can We Have Environmental Conversations, Please?</b>  Why is it so difficult to talk about or come to action on environmental issues, when it seems as if all humans should care in making progress on how we take care of the non-human world? Our seminar will examine the impediments and the possibilities for such conversations by looking at various matters: the environmental mantra Think Globally, Act Locally; the environmental framework of Integral Ecology and its relation to Pope Francis encyclical <i>Laudago Si</i>; food production in the United States; and St. Olaf Colleges efforts to be good stewards of the non-human world. Students will read texts, research current events, watch films, and write essays in order to examine how we might promote environmental conversations. Intellectual play as well as experiential learning will be encouraged. (Open to Environmental Conversations students only.)"
