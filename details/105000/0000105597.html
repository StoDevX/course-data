	EDUC 382: Human Relations (0 Cr)
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> All candidates must have a multicultural field experience to help develop their competence in teaching in multicultural environments. A minimum of 80 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment (an Interim or its equivalent) is required prior to student teaching. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: EDUC 170: <i>Urban Schools and Communities</i>; EDUC 347: <i>Teaching English as a Second</i> <i>Language</i>; EDUC 378: <i>Multicultural Education in Hawaii</i>; EDUC 379: <i>Urban Education Seminar and Practicum</i>; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools with special cognitive component. See Education Department faculty and website for advice and information. EDUC 382 is not a course. Rather it is a recording mechanism indicating St. Olaf students who have completed their multicultural education requirement. Students register for EDUC 382 during their professional semester. P/N only. Offered each semester. </p>
