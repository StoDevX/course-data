	WRIT 111D: First-Year Writing
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p><b>Border Crossings</b>. This seminar examines the concept of crossing borders--geographically as well as metaphorically. Using readings from journalism, nonfiction, and fiction, we examine the reasons for leaving home and breaching a boundary and the ways people create a new life on the other side. Issues we explore include 2016 as the year of the greatest refugee crisis in recorded history; "border syndrome" as an emotional state (Gazmend Kapllani, <i>A Border Crossing Handbook</i>); the body's borders and the limits of medicine (the journalists who reported on the Ebola crisis); undocumented immigration to the United States (Sonia Nazario, <i>Enrique's Journey</i>), and the thin line between life and death (Markus Zusak, <i>The Book Thief</i>). We focus on the process of writing, revision, and contextual research in short assingments, with each student's work culminating in a "thick description" of a border crossing. </p>
