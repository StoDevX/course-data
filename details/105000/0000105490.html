	WRIT 111A: First-Year Writing
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p><b>The Violence of Contemporary Life</b>. This seminar will address an unsettling claim made by a number of recent American and Anglophone artists: that the seemingly mundane acts of self care and domesticity, of finding and maintaining work, of being with others on the other side of normal, entail daily encounters with direct and hidden forms of violence. From Margaret Atwood's dystopian fictions of authoritarian patriarchy and Claudia Rankine's harrowing, poetic account of living as an African-American citizen of the United States to Alex Gibney's documentary film on military torture <i>Taxi to the Dark Side</i>, and Kendrick Lamar's recent album about growing up in Compton, <i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City</i>, we will scour contemporary works that approach everyday violence, particularly as it is inflected by questions of race, gender, and sexuality. We will ask: how do certain modes of representation depict, contest, promote, and even produce violence? And what do we mean by "violence" anyway? What counts and what does not? Writing assignments will begin with short blog posts, a close reading essay devoted to a single work, and a film review, and build toward a final research project. </p>
