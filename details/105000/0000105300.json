		"<b>The Bible as Screen Play</b>  Movies have become our common language, one of the principal means by which we communicate and interpret our experiences and ideas (not to mention our primary form of entertainment).  Biblical stories and themes have been a central source for filmmakers from the very beginning of the medium.  What happens to those stories and themes in the process?  What does the process of filmmaking teach us about how the Biblical authors may have brought their stories to life in their time?  How do films illuminate the Biblical text, and how are contemporary perspectives, values, and prejudices reflected in the filmmakers' work? The balcony is open. Please note that the films will be screened outside of class; there will be a weekly scheduled screening, and the films will be available on library reserve for those unable to attend."
