	WRIT 111M: First-Year Writing
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p><b>Language Matters.</b> Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other peoples minds. Languagespoken, signed, and writtenis one of the most important ways we influence others and construct ourselves. This seminar is designed for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we may address include: How have time, technology, and travel changed the English language? How do advertisers manipulate language? Why are bad words bad? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama show us how some authors have thought through these questions. We discuss these authors ideas and the moves they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience, and on the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of your drafts. </p>
