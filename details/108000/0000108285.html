	WRIT 111F: First-Year Writing
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>HIP HOP GENERATION. How did we get from Watergate and DJ Kool Hercs break to Obamas playlists and <i>Yeezus</i>? This seminar uses hip-hop culture as a guide to the social, political, and economic changes that have taken place in the US since the early 1970s. We will focus on the historical circumstances and unique spaces out of which hip hop arises as well as the cultures own conception of history and aesthetics, its poetics of place. While our abiding interest will be the transformations of musical sound and urban culture over the last forty years, we will also attend to the wide-ranging influence that hip hop has had on documentary and feature film, journalism, literature, dance, advertising, visual art, and even, perhaps, US politics. Writing assignments will be developmental in nature, beginning with short, close listening exercises and album reviews and building toward a final digitial project that incorporates various media to construct its argument. </p>
