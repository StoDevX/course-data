	</p>
<p>Bio 391: in this seminar course we will examine how animal vision has evolved to meet ecological needs and enable specific behavioral tasks such as prey capture, predator avoidance, navigation, mate selection, and communication. Topics will include the visual environment, biological optics, structure and function of photoreceptors, color vision, polarization vision, motion detection, stereovision, decision making, development of the visual system, and "the dress." The course will be grounded in the primary literature, and class time will consist of discussion and group work. Prerequisite: BIO 227 or NEURO 239 or permission of instructor. </p>
