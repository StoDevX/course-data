<p>READING THE BIBLE AROUND THE WORLD. What does the place one reads the Bible matter? What difference does who one reads with make? These questions are central to this section. Composed in what we call the Middle East, the Bible has been carried around the world. The Bible is one thing Christians in have in common, though the context in which they read it varies. Protestant Reformers insisted that the Bible be made available in the vernacular, common language of believers. Missionaries make translating the Bible among their first tasks. Despite agreement that the Bible is central to faith differing readings of the Bible often lead to disputes and divisions among Christians. In this section we consider both what the Bible says and to how it is heard/read by various audiences. We pay particular attention to readers in the global south, where Christianity is growing, read this book. In addition, we look at the ways artists interpret the Bible in images drawn from the culture of their time and place. We ask what constitutes a good reading and what factors contribute to one. </p>
