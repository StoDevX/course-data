	REL 121L: Bible in Culture and Community
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>THE BIBLE AND ETHICS. The primary focus of this section will be on what the Bible says about God's relation to humanity and world as these are created good, fallen into sin and corruption, being redeemed through Christ and the covenants, and to be fully renewed in the age of come. We will explore the bearing of these theological perspectives for ethical analysis of such moral issues as relativism, moral conflict, guilt, forgiveness, suffering, war, poverty, and sexism. </p>
