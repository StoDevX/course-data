		"DOING DEMOCRACY: THE POLITICS OF FOOD. Why do you eat what you eat? What does this say about you and your relationship to people, the environment, animals, and politics? Finally, how is the act of eating a political action, akin to public discourse? The theme of this writing course will explore various philosophies of food consumption and distribution, asking and debating questions about why certain communities experience obesity and abundance while others suffer from starvation and lack. We will investigate farming and agribusiness, philosophies of food consumption such as vegetarianism and the slow foods movement, and personal food and cooking habits. As a class, we will frame our discussions and writings around contemporary readings, advertisements, documentaries, film representations, fictional texts, recipes and cookbooks, and academic texts. As part of this exploration into how food and democracy go hand in hand, you will be expected to write a wide variety of genres including a food narrative, controversy analysis, researched argument, public argument, and manifesto."
