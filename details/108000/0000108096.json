		"A WHOLESOME MATERIALITY: ECONOMICS, ETHICS AND THE BIBLE. What does the Bible have to do with contemporary ideas about the economy and economic justice? Can the Bible be used to guide our economic as well as spiritual practices? Understanding that economics means the law of the household, this section will read the Bible in light of issues such as wealth, prosperity, taxes, private property, and the market. To do so, we will look at the economic concerns of a diverse biblical world rooted in an agrarian economy, tracing the recurrence of themes such as justice, poverty, oppression, idolatry and care for the land. Alongside of this focus on the Bible itself, we will examine how philosophers, theologians, and economists read the Bible to support certain economic practices, both in the past and within the contemporary context. Doing so will allow us to inquire about the relevance of the Bible for reflecting on the ethics behind our economic choices today."
