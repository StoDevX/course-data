<p>SCIENCE FICTION. The popularity of science fiction stems not only from its speculations about the future but also from what it tells us about the present. In this course we will explore the temporal fluidity of science fiction along with many of its other generic features, including plots, settings, characters, ideological perspectives, and explanations of science and technology. Students will read both sci-fi novels and short stories by influential authors from H.G. Wells to Kim Stanley Robinson. Considering the importance of cinema to the sci-fi genre, the course will also host a number of screenings, including relevant film adaptations of literary texts covered in the class. The course is likely to include WellsÂ’s <i>War of the Worlds</i>, Isaac Asimov's <i>I, Robot</i>, Ray Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, Philip K. Dick's <i>So Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i> and Ursula K. Le Guin's <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, along with such film classics as <i>Metropolis, Things to Come, The Day the Earth Stood Still, 2001, Blade Runner</i> and <i>Gattaca</i>. Finally, students will read scholarly texts on both specific works and the sci-fi genre as a whole. </p>
