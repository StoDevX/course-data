		"NATURE IMAGERY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. Georgia OKeeffe once wrote, My center does not come from my mind  it feels in me like a plot of warm moist well tilled earth with the sun shining on it. Many of her landscapes express this outlook and the belief she and so many Americans have shared that American culture comes to know itself best through nature and the environment. This seminar is about learning to read pictures, whether or not you know much about art, and sharing our understanding of pictures by writing ever more capably as the semester progresses about nature imagery from various periods of American history. A relatively short research project will combine students skills in reading nature imagery with insight into how groups battling over environmental and energy exploration issues have employed landscapes and pictures of animals and plants to advance their positions."
