	MUSIC 345: Advanced Study in Music History
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>Early missions to Africa brought hymns and European harmony, while more recent missions have paved the way for praise and worship music to enter the African everyday. At the same time, pieces flow freely across African borders regardless of linguistic differences and African pieces find their way into North American worship. This course will examine how Christian churches serve as transnational agents of cultural production, focusing on anxieties of both missionaries and the missionized from the late 19th century through the present. Prerequisites: Music 241 and 242. WRI pending committee approval. </p>
