		"Solving complex environmental problems and generating creative work requires the integration and application of multiple ways of knowing. Team projects connected to community needs bring the departments three areas of emphasis into conversation within an experiential learning framework. The course attends to the nature of environmental inquiry and creativity, ones own perspectives and values, and how to use ones knowledge and skills to contribute in personal, civic and work related roles.  Course satisfies the experiential component requirement.  Prerequisites:  EnvSt 137, at least 1 course in two of the three areas of emphasis, and a declared EnvSt major or concentrator."
