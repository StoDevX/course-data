	ENGL 280A: Topics in Genre
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>American poetry of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is noted for constant innovation in free-verse forms. We will read an expanse of poets and forms, and create a timeline for the rise of major schools of aesthetics such as: Imagism, Confessionalism, Black Mountain School, New York School, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, Black Arts Movement and late multicultural collections, American Surrealism, among others. WeÂ’ll also read various ideologies and philosophies of poetry writing, including manifestos, to examine how innovations move the orthodox lines of U.S. narrative and lyric verse forms (if at all). Students will analyze, imitate, and experiment with the conventions that we study each week with opportunities for feedback throughout the term. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
