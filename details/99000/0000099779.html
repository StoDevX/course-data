	WRIT 111K: First-Year Writing
	(2015-2016, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>Personal Narratives - Students in this seminar work the whole semester to develop a single personal narrative, one made of shorter essays that develop their skill at writing description, analysis, and argumentation. For the short essays, for example, they develop statements that draw on their memories from childhood, involving recollections of a place, person, and incidents. Ultimately, they produce seamless stories that integrate these accounts and incorporate an array of genres. In the course of writing a neighborhood biography or migrant or farm story, or an immigrant account or family secret, or a recession story, they also learn to research in the library crucial details and to gather information from interviews. Finally, after reading models of excellent writing produced by contemporary American authors who focus in their work on issues of American identity and after working regularly in peer groups, they develop a keen sense of their audience. </p>
