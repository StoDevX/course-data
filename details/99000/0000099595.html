<p>The Bible With and Without Religion - The question of what it is to be religious or non-religious can be enriched by study of the Bible. In the course of studying the Bible in conjunction with this question, what seems to be non-religious can instead be deeply religious and what may appear holy might turn out to be merely profane. Students examine the Bible in light of both non-religious and religious interpretations, ranging from ancient writings significant to the texts of the Bible or selections from the present day. Additionally, students attend to the history, use, and problems of such concepts as religion, secular, and many related matters. To do this, we need to read theology, philosophy, comic books, plays, and a novel alongside of the Bible. </p>
