		"\"Things are in the Saddle,/ And Ride Mankind\"....Emerson - In this seminar, we will think, talk, and write about things, exploring together the relations between people and stuff, dipping into creative and theoretical readings from the field of material culture studies. As always in a first-year seminar, we will work throughout the semester on writing skills, both at the sentence level and in a variety of essays. Some books we may read together include Taking Things Seriously; Life at Home in the Twenty-First Century: 32 Families Open Their Doors, and The Mezzanine."
