		"Think Globally, Act Locally - An environmental mantra in recent decades has been Think Globally, Act Locally. Is this simply a catchy phrase? Or a call to action? A framework for living? Students will read texts, research current events, watch films, and write essays in order to examine the adequacy of this slogan in regards to environmentalism. Intellectual play as well as experiential learning will be encouraged. You must be enrolled in the Environmental Conversations program to take this course."
