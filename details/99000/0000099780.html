	WRIT 111I: First-Year Writing
	(2015-2016, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>Literacy and Language Politics - This seminar has a special emphasis on critical reading, writing, and thinking through the lens of literacy and language politics. It will not be a strict nuts and bolts approach to the writing and language practices that will be expected of you at a liberal arts college Â– though, rest assured, we will discuss these practices. More importantly, we will consider what language is, how and why we engage with the written word, and how to convey our ideas most effectively in diverse contexts. These questions, both big picture and small, are crucial when evolving into better writers, thinkers, and stewards of language. </p>
