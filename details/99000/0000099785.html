	WRIT 111G: First-Year Writing
	(2015-2016, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>Writing About Film - The ways that we evaluate and write about film reflect the influence of a number of factors, including the dominance of certain approaches to the cinema, our intended audience, and the wide-ranging and often antithetical formulations of film as a cultural object. This seminar explores various forms of film writing, from mainstream, popular reviews that understand cinema largely in relation to consumption and entertainment to more theoretical essays that engage with the intricacies and politics of film form. In addition to examining reviews in newspapers, magazines, and other mass-media, we will read the work of well-known cultural critics such as James Agee, Manny Farber, Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris, the members of Cahiers du Cin√©ma, Jonathan Rosenbaum, and Girish Shambu as well as more polemical and academic writings that focus on the impact of film on class, gender, race and other social formations. The seminar will introduce students to the basic terminology and language required for formal film analysis and criticism (mise-en-scene, editing, cinematography, genre, narrative, authorship, stardom), and ultimately ask them to incorporate this language (and its permutations) in their own writing. Counts toward film studies and media studies concentrations. </p>
