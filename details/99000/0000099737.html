	ENGL 285: Digital Rhetorics and New Media Literacies
	(2015-2016, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Students explore what it means to be literate in an age of new media by reading critical scholarship and comparing the ways they read, interpret, and learn from digital texts, such as fan fiction websites, social media, and video games, to ways they read, interpret, and learn from printed media (e.g., books, poems, or plays). In their final, digital project, students critically examine the use of new media to make humanities scholarship more "public." Offered periodically. Counts toward media studies concentration. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
