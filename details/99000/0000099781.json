		"Truth and Truths - What is a knowledge claim? How can we make a statement of truth? What counts as sufficient evidence to support an argument? Isaiah Berlin once said that some philosophers provided us with Truth and others provided us with truths. This seminar explores this complicated theme and how it relates to why we are at college. We will learn to make an argument that stands up to scrutiny and criticism. Through films, plays, and performances, as well as analysis of other courses we will be taking in the term, we will examine what makes a valid truth claim and how to defend claims with empirical evidence and philosophical argument. Films, plays, and performances may include Rashomon, The Square, theater department offerings, and current debates in American politics. Our assignments include the design of thoughtful thesis statements, concise abstracts, short essays, and research designs. Throughout the semester, we will share our ideas about our readings and films to learn how truth is experienced in the quest for knowledge."
