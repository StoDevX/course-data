	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Homer's epics, Hesiod's account of creation and his farmer's almanac, the tragedies of 5th-century Athens, the national epics of Ovid and Vergil: mythical patterns and images from ancient texts still pervade our culture's music, drama, art and film. Many students plug in and appreciate for the first time the richness and relevance of their Greek and Roman inheritance. GE: ALS-L. Offered in alternate years. </p>
