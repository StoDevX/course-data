	ENGL 276: Literature and the Environment
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Through nonfiction, fiction and poetry, students explore the complex relations between humans and the "natural" world. Students consider questions such as: What does it mean to be connected to a landscape? What is a sense of place? Students also reflect about how they and the writers they read put landscape and experiences into language. </p>
