	AMCON 201A: Re-making America, 1865-1945
	(2005-2006, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Burgeoning cities and industrialism, an emerging market economy, changing opportunities for women, an influx of immigrants and the migration of African Americans to urban centers -- all opened questions of freedom of expression, distribution of resources and American identity. Topics and texts include the Statue of Liberty, the World's Columbian Exposition, the Model T Ford and the Harlem Renaissance. </p>
