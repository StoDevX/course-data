	SOAN 292B: Anthropological Theory
	(2008-2009, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces students to anthropological theory and the "culture" of the discipline itself. Students examine anthropology's formation during the Industrial Revolution and the Age of Empire, which called for new explanations of human differences and gave new significance to the nature and meaning of "culture." They explore the method of participant observation research, the question of whether anthropology is a science, the problem of representing one culture to another, and the changing nature of ethnographic writing. Open to Sociology/Anthropology majors only. Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course. Offered Fall Semester. </p>
