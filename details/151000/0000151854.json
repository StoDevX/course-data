		"What changes in the room when the conductor raises their baton? Or the lights go down and a single voice wafts through a cathedral? Or when a choir sings a particular chord, and without a conscious decision, the hair raises on your arms? What is it that can move a crowd of thousands to rise to their feet and dance? This class will explore how music barges into our lives with few boundaries and causes us to react. We will explore how music can lower blood pressure and ease our thoughts, but can also do the opposite. We will attend concerts and rehearsals, interview musicians, and scientists, all in an exploration of what it means to experience music. We will also work on discovering how culture, society and the common person relates and reacts to melody and rhythm. As a class and in our own experiences we will reflect and raise questions and search for answers both scientific and perhaps mysterious. We will have discussions on the rhythm of life through music."
