		"Have you noticed that despite our unprecedented access to news, entertainment, and social networks, it can often seem harder to stay informed and easier to feel disconnected? This feeling has a history, and this course follows the rise of the modern media--from the transnational networks built in the 19th century to the growth of broadcast media in the 20th and the rapid spread of social media in the 21st. We not only explore the histories of technological change (the telegraph, the television, and the internet), but also grapple with the questions they have raised about knowledge, free speech, social fracture, and the future of democracy. Of course, our daily experience of media is deeply personal, and through a series of readings, conversations, and short essays we discover why our media landscape appears the way it does and how we can find a stable and healthy orientation within it."
