		"This course examines the creative, social, and political work of women in the Middle East and North Africa in the wake of the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings (2010-2015). While the protests that took place across the MENA region primarily targeted government corruption and economic despair, issues of women's rights and freedoms were also at the forefront in Morocco, Algeria, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere. This topics course will ask how debates around education, physical autonomy, and gendered violence depicted and critiqued in novels, short stories, movies, and graphic novels of the last 20 years. We will primarily analyze fictional texts by women in order to engage with the social and political context from which they were created. Students will also study secondary texts, social media, and media in and outside the MENA region, and will develop an individual research project based on their own centers of interest. Counts Toward Concentrations: International Relations, Middle Eastern Studies"
