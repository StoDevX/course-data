	PSYCH 271A: Psychology of Personality
	(2007-2008, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Students examine theories of normal personality development in an effort to understand the factors that shape personality. Is personality biologically determined? Is it a result of interpersonal experiences, learning and reinforcement? Are other factors involved as well? We investigate prominent personality theories and research and their conceptualizations of this fundamental aspect of human experience. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. Offered each year. </p>
