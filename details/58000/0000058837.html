Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b>The Middle Ages</b> focuses upon Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature, including the Beowulf poet, Chaucer, Julian of Norwich, and Malory, in the context of emerging ideas such as heroism, the role of women, and the relationship between secular society and the Church. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b>The Renaissance</b> examines radical literary changes in English literature, as they occur in Spenser, Shakespeare, Lanyer, Donne, and Milton, in such contexts as the Protestant Reformation and strife over Puritanism, court politics under Elizabeth and James, and the English Civil War. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <b>The Age of Englightenment</b> focuses upon neoclassical poetry and satire and the emergence of the novel.
