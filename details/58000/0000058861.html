	ENVST 255: Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
	(2007-2008, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Remote sensing and GIS are increasingly used to address basic and applied questions in the environmental sciences and a host of other disciplines. Students survey available remote sensing image types and learn to process (ground-truthing, GPS, scanning, digitizing) and interpret remotely sensed images. They also learn theory and practice of geographic information systems (basic cartography and spatial statistics). A weekly 3-hour laboratory is required. Counts toward major and concentration: Environmental Studies. Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 137 or a Level 1 course in biology, chemistry or physics. </p>
