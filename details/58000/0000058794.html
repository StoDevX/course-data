	PHIL 243: Aesthetics
	(2007-2008, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Philosophers have long been interested in art: its nature, its value, its meaning, and the standards by which it should be judged. This course investigates those issues and others related to creativity and the visual and other arts. Students develop their appreciation and understanding of the aesthetic properties of art by analyzing particular works in light of major texts in the philosophy of art and art criticism. Offered every year. </p>
