Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, John Dos Passos' <i>The Manhattan Transfer</i>, Raymond Chandler's <i>The Big Sleep</i>, James Baldwin's <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>, Paul Auster's <i>City of Glass</i>, and Jeffrey Eugenides' <i>Middlesex</i>.

Story</i>, Guy Maddin's <i>My Winnipeg</i>, Sophia Coppoloa's <i>Lost in Translation</i>, and Spike Lee's <i>When the Levees Broke</i>."
