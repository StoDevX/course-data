		"How should we define \"the good life\"?  As Success?  Or meaning? As stability or happiness or comfort?  And what factors might be the measure of a \"good life\" life? Career or family, carbon footprint or social contributions, health or notoriety? In this seminar, students will investigate how authors, philosophers, theologians, and internet influencers have defined \"the good life\" and they will research how certain collegiate behaviors contribute to happiness, isolation, selfishness or community flourishing. Ultimately, students will define what the good life means to them and reflect on how their own choices (about classes, majors, co-curricular activities, friend groups, family, and free time) might help or hinder their intentions."
