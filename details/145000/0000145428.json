		"Work interweaves every aspect of our lives, from how we survive, how we relate to one another, and how we create and attach value to things. Over time, work has shaped societies, cultures, specializations, public life, family life, belief systems, and much more. As we navigate a world marked by high production, consumption, inequality, and discontent, work has increasingly become an integral activity in how we find meaning in our lives. On the flipside, work can often mark the boundaries where leisure and pleasure begin, and whether achieving balance is ever possible or worth pursuing. In this seminar, we will study significant episodes throughout history that may enable us to understand the nature of work, why we do it, and what the future of work holds. Assigned readings, films, music selections, and weekly activities will provide us with the language, concepts, and context to explore the rich legacy of work."
