		"This course examines the culture of girls and girlhood in a global context. Girls are an important part of all communities, yet the physical, emotional, and social landscape of girls often remains below our notice. The transition from girl to woman is an experience that has changed radically across time and place yet the landmarks of girlhood remain remarkably unchanged. Girls make up billions of dollars in the consumer media industry, yet also suffer disproportionately from the increasing disappearance of protections for privacy and personal freedom. Girl culture is critically shaped by issues of race, gender, and class informing not only the experiences of girlhood but those of the women they will become. From play to trafficking, \"alternative\" forms of aggression and bullying, education and empowerment, gossip, social justice, bodies and body image, media, friendships, gender identity and trans issues, puberty, dreams of becoming a scientist or a Youtube star, we will explore the many facets of being a girl."
