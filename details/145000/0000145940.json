		"This course will study postcolonial literature from across the British empire and the Anglophone postcolonies. Novelists, poets, philosophers, revolutionaries, anthropologists, and psychologists will guide us through a set of overarching questions: What has it meant to be a subject of European empire and a citizen of postcolonial nation states? How do the experiences of the imperial past resonate in the postcolony and the (ex-)metropole? And what place have the literary arts occupied within this conversation? We will inform our encounters with literature by reading in the fields of postcolonial studies, history, film, the visual arts, music, and dance. Possible writers include Jean Rhys, Zadie Smith, Paul Gilroy, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Jasbir Puar, Mohsin Hamid, Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh, Flann O'Brien, and Michael Ondaatje.\""
