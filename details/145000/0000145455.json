		"Students practice college success skills and study history in a unique way by playing two Reacting to the Past role-immersion games. The first game is set in Ancient Greece, where, as Athenians, students debate the merits of democracy in Classical Athens after the Peloponnesian War. In the second game, set in Imperial China, students adopt the personas of Grand Secretaries of the Hanlin Academy and apply Confucian principles to issues of governance and social order during a time of crisis in the Forbidden City. Most class sessions are run by students, who learn about history by experiencing it for themselves. While playing the games, students practice critical reading, research, oral and written communication, and collaboration, among other skills. Along the way, students participate in enduring debates about democracy, free speech, the nature of justice, good government, altruism and humaneness, and the tension between moral principles and political authority."
