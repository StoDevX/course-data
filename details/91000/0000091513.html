	BIO 341: Advanced Cell Biology
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The cell is the fundamental unit of life, capable of growth, motility, signal transduction, and functional specialization. Students study features common to cells: their macromolecular components, metabolism, membrane transport, motility, signal mechanisms, and intracellular trafficking, seeing how these are elaborated in cells with particular specializations. Research techniques suitable for cell biology are emphasized. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 227 and 233, or Biology 125 and 233, or permission of instructor. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. </p>
