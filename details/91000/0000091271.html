	ENGL 391: Major British Authors
	(2013-2014, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Students examine the work of a major British author. Through attention to life experiences, cultural contexts, and the impact of history, the course offers students a complex understanding of a major author's literary achievement. Recent authors have included Milton, Dickens, George Eliot, Joyce, and Woolf. Because such study is intensive and requires background, students should have prior exposure to the author studied. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisites: English 185 plus at least two English courses at level II, or permission of the instructor.
