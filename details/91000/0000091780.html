<p> This course introduces students to the complicated relationship between philosophy and literature from any period between the 16th-century to the present day.

Students gain an understanding of modern philosophies by learning how to incorporate interdisciplinary theories when engaging in literary analysis. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years. </p>
