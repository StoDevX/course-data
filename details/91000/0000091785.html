	BIO 227A: Cell Biology
	(2013-2014, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course provides a comprehensive overview of cellular structure and function including cellular compartments, macromolecular structures, and life processes such as energy and material flux, cell division, and control mechanisms. Students learn current and/or historical evidence and methodology (e.g., microscopy, isolation procedures, and probes). Laboratory experiences provide opportunities for qualitative and quantitative observations of cellular structure and function. Students place their work in the context of current research through examination of relevant literature and formal presentations. Prerequisites: Biology 150 and Chemistry 125 or Chemistry 121/123 or Chemistry/Biology 125. Offered each semester. Counts toward biomolecular science concentration (for students through class of 2016). </p>
