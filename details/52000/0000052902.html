	(2006-2007, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This brief study of the structure and function of molecules common to living organisms such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats and DNA includes speculation on the formation of the solar system and the early chemical history of the earth and examination of possible mechanisms by which smaller and then larger molecules may have formed, from which the present great diversity of life has evolved. Prerequisite: high school chemistry or biology. Offered during Interim. </p>
