	(2006-2007, Semester 2)

Social workers work for justice by creating, implementing and evaluating policies in income, employment, housing and child welfare. Students study policy formation and analysis that reflect interests and powers of diverse groups as well as economic and social needs of certain populations at risk, especially women, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians and Latinos.
