	SOAN 231: Modern Ireland: Conflict and Change in a Postcolonial Society (abroad)
	(2006-2007, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Ireland, renowned for scenic vistas, literary and musical heritage, is also the site of important post-colonial social change. This course examines changes in Irish culture and institutions coinciding with European/global restructuring and troubles in Northern Ireland. We begin in the western (Gaeltacht-Irish speaking) rural counties of Galway and Mayo, move to the Northern Irish city of Derry and conclude in urban Dublin. Offered during Interim. </p>
