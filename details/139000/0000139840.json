		"The Bright Ages: The European Middle Ages and the World - Theres no such thing as the Dark Ages. Rome didnt fall. The Renaissance didnt make everything nice. And most of the stories told most commonly in popular culture about medieval times turns out to be wrong. In this class, well move through a thousand years of European history and see how although things changed, Europe always remained a complicated place with permeable boundaries in touch with the rest of the world. It was a Bright Age indeed, illuminated with vibrant colorful passing through stained glass windows and the fires of burning books and cities alike."
