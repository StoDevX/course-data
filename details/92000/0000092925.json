		"This course investigates how literature--broadly writ--represents both gender diversity and",
		"conformity, and the issues associated with gender, such as family, power dynamics, oppression,",
		"activism, domesticity, hierarchies, and inequalities. The texts focus on a diversity of gendered",
		"identities by complicating the gender binary of \"man\" and \"woman.\" A consideration",
		"of gender separated from other identities is limiting; therefore, this course examines how gender",
		"intersects with race, class, ability, sexual orientation, technology, religion, and/or nationality.",
		"May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years. Click on course",
