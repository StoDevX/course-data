	PHIL 120: Philosophy in Literature
	(2013-2014, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Literature provides rich resources for thinking through central philosophical questions, including the metaphysics and ethics of freedom; the problem of evil; the role of character in choice and action; the nature of morality; rebellion and human solidarity; God's existence and relation to the world; and the nature of truth. Designed primarily for first-year students, this course explores philosophical ideas in literary works of several different genres by studying plot, character, point of view, imagery, and symbolism. Offered during Interim. </p>
