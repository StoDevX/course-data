		"To what extent do you create your identity? And how much do popular culture, technology, education, and social categories such as race, class, gender influence the ways that you view yourself and others, and how others view you? This seminar focuses on self and identity as we consider who we are individually and within groups and institutions. We begin by exploring theories and data about Generation Z -- the generation born between 1997 and 2012. We draw from comics, short essays, and your own research to understand questions about identity and to develop creative and researched projects that respond to those questions. This seminar is writing intensive and focuses intentionally on the writing process. You'll practice communicating ideas with compelling words and images to convey who you are today and the person you imagine becoming."
