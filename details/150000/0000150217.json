		"Chris Robinson, lead guitarist for the Black Crowes once stated, \"Musicians playing together, it's like a conversation, and ideally I want our conversation to be really intriguing and interesting and beautiful.\" In this course, we will have intriguing, interesting, and beautiful conversations about the power of music and the role it plays in our lives. We will read about and explore the lives and artistry of famous musicians such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Prince, as well as their roles as agents of social change. Further, through journaling short essay writing, and the creation of a personal song playlist, we will reflect on our potential as future leaders and the roles that music may play in this development."
