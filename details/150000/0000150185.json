		"This course examines human responses to epidemic diseases in world history. Beginning with the pandemics of the Ancient world, students explore topics such as the 14th-century Black Death, \"virgin soil\" epidemics in the Americas, London's cholera outbreak of the 1850s, as well as more recent events, from the 1918 influenza pandemic to Covid-19. Students ponder the medical, social, political, and cultural impacts of disease through an exploration of diverse topics ranging from the discovery of microbes to the recent popularity of zombie movies."
