		"Americans have long understood their diverse identities through stories. This course analyzes familiar and less familiar narratives that have formed and re-formed identity in the context of American culture.  We explore autobiographical writing (like that of Benjamin Franklin and Gloria Anzaldúa), feature films (such as <i>Good Will Hunting</i> and <i>Get Out</i>), and historic sites and monuments (e.g., Jeffersons Monticello and Confederate statues).  Students examine these literary works, media, and cultural artifacts, paying attention to the forms and themes through which compelling American stories and histories are constructed. The seminar also stresses the development of speaking, listening, and collaboration skills, alongside a conventional emphasis on writing.  Additionally, both course assignments and SOAR activities invite students to reflect on their own experience and learning"
