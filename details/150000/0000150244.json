		"In today's data-driven world, we frequently hear about the \"power\" of data. However, it is crucial to take a closer look at the power dynamics inherent in data itself and delve into the concept of \"data justice.\" This course aims to examine the role of data in our lives and critically analyze how data reflects and perpetuates societal power structures and biases. By uncovering these underlying dynamics, we can gain a better understanding of the systems of privilege and discrimination that are reinforced by data collection. Throughout the course, we will explore alternative perspectives on data, influenced by the principles of intersectional feminism, and actively work towards defining and expanding upon the principles of data justice. This course is NOT a mathematics or a statistics course, and no mathematical or statistical knowledge is assumed. All students are welcome! A key component of the course is a weekly data journal where students are required to collect and engage creatively in the presentation of data."
