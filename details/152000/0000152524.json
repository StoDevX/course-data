		"through some unusual thematic territory. We examine the dialectic of meaninglessness and faith,",
		"boredom and passion, solitude and silence; we ask about the joy and pain of embodiment; and we",
		"explore forms of love and commitment. Discussions take place in the Danish classroom, but also",
		"on-site in the parks, squares, churches, castles, and surrounding forests mentioned in his works."
