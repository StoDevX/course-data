		"How did we get from Richard Nixon and DJ Kool Herc's break to Obama's playlists and Cardi B? This seminar uses hip-hop culture as a guide to the social, political, economic, and artistic changes that have taken place in the US since the early 1970s. We will focus on the historical circumstances and unique spaces out of which hip-hop has arisen as well as the culture's own conceptions of history, social life, and aesthetics, or what you might call its poetics of place. Our study of hip-hop culture will encourage us to think about writing as a process, a practice of daily attention and development. To this end, you will learn to write in diverse formats, from close listening exercises and album reviews to personal reflection papers and a research-driven essay. As a class, we will participate in a semester-long series of workshops that will invite you to generate and circulate drafts among your peers, respond to and provide feedback on the work of others, and revise your writing."
