		"What does it mean for art to be \"good\" or \"bad?\" For example, why does Instagram poetry raise questions about its validity as art? What about paintings that try to be ugly? What makes the film <i>The Room</i> \"so bad it's good?\" This seminar explores forms of \"bad\" and \"ugly\" art--specifically in poetry, visual art, and on the screen--that nevertheless attract attention and praise. Our reading, writing, and discussion aim to clarify the nature and the stakes of the most fundamental questions related to art, literature, and aesthetics. Does beauty have an essence that can be identified, qualified, and quantified independent of culture? Is there a connection between our sense of what is \"beautiful\" and our sense of what is \"good\" or \"just\" or \"ethical\"? We'll go beyond art to consider how our individual aesthetic tastes influence our friendships and relationships tastes? Students will read, view, watch, and write in order to learn about existing aesthetic theories and to develop their own. Major writing assignments will include a \"letter of recommendation\" for an object or text that you think is \"beautiful\" and a research project that examines an \"ugly\" work of art within the context of existing aesthetic theories."
