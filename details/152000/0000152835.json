		"With more than one billion overweight adults in the world today, obesity has become an epidemic. But fat is not straightforward, or universally damned. Body size, shape, and even fat as a concept are as much socially constructed as physically so. Using resources from anthropologists and sociologists working around the globe, as well as fat activists, body-positive icons, and everyday individuals, this course offers an unconventional and critical look at fat as a concept, a substance, and a lifestyle. Addressed from a global perspective we take on questions of size and masculinity in the NFL, sugar as a weapon of poverty, phat power, fat shaming, and more. Weaving in conversations on race, gender, and class as well as the many entanglements of economics, beauty, power, questions of traditionalism and modernity, prosperity, mobility, morality, and public health, this course challenges students to reconsider how the body -- how we live in and with it -- shapes our perceptions of the world around us."
