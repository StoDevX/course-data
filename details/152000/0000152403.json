		"Are you always on the clock? Is time money? What should time management really mean? How we keep and tell time is something we often take for granted  and yet humankind's understanding and categorization of this universal force has been an evolving reflection of our relationship with culture, the arts, technology, and our own intersectional identities. In this seminar, we'll explore several avenues related to time including the roots of \"being on time\" tied to the advent of America's railway system, the vinyl record and CD shaping the nature and length of music, social media's influence on how we \"pass the time\", the role of smart and analog timekeeping devices, and how time has irrevocably evolved for many during the Covid pandemic. Major assignments will include personal narratives and reflective journals, a commercial/media rhetorical analysis, a creative project, and a major research essay."
