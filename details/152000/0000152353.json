		"In this course, students read nonfiction about the natural world, including memoirs, travelogues, field guides, and essays. Students examine the historical development of the idea of nature. Focus is also given to recent nature literature, which aims to preserve vanishing language for the environment and \"re-enchant\" the human appreciation for local nature. Students read about landscapes, animals, and plants from a wide variety of viewpoints, including indigenous, queer, and neurodivergent perspectives. As they discuss readings, students also work to deepen their own connection with local nature at St. Olaf."
