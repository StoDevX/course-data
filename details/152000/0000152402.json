		"What are the roots of inequality, in America and across the globe?  In <i>Caste</i>, her provocative critique of race in American society, Isabel Wilkerson uses multiple stories and personal experience to argue that caste is a code buried beneath the surface of race relations in the U.S. That code uses notions of heredity, group purity, stigma, and enforcement through terror in ways similar to the Hindu caste system's suppression of the Dalits (the Untouchables) and Nazi Germany's scapegoating of the Jews. Does this explanation of social superiority and inferiority hold up against theories of economic competition and the nature of prejudice? Readings include Wilkerson's <i>Caste</i>, Marcus Zusak's <i>The Book Thief</i>, and either Aravind Adiga's <i>The White Tiger</i> or John Okada's <i>No-No Boy</i>. This seminar requires of students an openness to honest conversation and passion for reading."
