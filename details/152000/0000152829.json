		"What does it mean to be free in America? How have understandings of freedom and unfreedom shaped political, intellectual, and religious life? Focused on the emergence of liberal ideology through Enlightenment thought, European and American revolutions, and the literary productions of figures and thinkers from DuBois, Dewey, and Addams to Abrams and Obama, this course focuses on the religious and historical processes framing how we presently perceive and think about un/freedom."
