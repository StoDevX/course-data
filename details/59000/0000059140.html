	NORW 130: Nordic Film Today: Love, Sex, and Family
	(2007-2008, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This film course focuses on the increasingly non-traditional ways of forming relationships in the Nordic countries. Rejecting the values of previous generations, young people from different backgrounds and ethnicities form relationships according to their own integrity and sexual preferences. Students attain an understanding of these cultural trends and the technical terminology to watch, read, think, talk, and write critically and intelligently about films as text. Taught in English. </p>
