	PSCI 249: Distributive Justice
	(2006-2007, Summer Session 1)
	</p>
<p> What distribution of wealth and the rewards from work and the possession of productive property is just? Are we entitled to economic support simply because we are members of society, or should we accept impoverishment as the just consequence of failure in the market? Students examine Christian and non-Christian ethical traditions from Europe and America which are devoted to answering these and related questions. </p>
