	ENGL 255: Backgrounds to Lit in English:Allusion, Influence, and Intertextuality
	(2012-2013, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces students to canonical texts (for example, the epics of Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Dante, and medieval romance) and explores their influence on various authors writing in English (for example, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Aphra Behn, T.S. Eliot, H.D., William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Sam Selvon). Rather than study classic works as isolated masterpieces, students explore how and why later writers and artists use these texts to shape their vision of the human experience. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years. Course not open to students who are taking or have completed the Great Conversation. </p>
