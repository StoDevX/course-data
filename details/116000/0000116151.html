	FAMST 120: I Want to Help People
	(2017-2018, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students explore service to human beings as a profession, both vocation and avocation. Who needs help? Who helps? Where? How? What motivates people to help? Using the liberal arts as a foundation for helping people, students study opportunities in areas such as health care, social services, ministry, youth work, and the arts. The class includes lectures, discussions, speakers, and field visits; additional fee. Open only to first-year students. Offered occasionally during Interim. </p>
