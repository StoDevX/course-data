	BIO 372: Developmental Biology
	(2011-2012, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The last decade has unveiled the mechanism by which a single cell gives rise to an embryo rich in pattern and cellular diversity. This course traces the use of surgical, genetic, and molecular techniques as they have uncovered the developmental blueprints encoding the universal body plan fundamental to all metazoan life. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 125,126, and 233; or Chemistry/Biology 125-127 and Biology 126 and 233. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. </p>
