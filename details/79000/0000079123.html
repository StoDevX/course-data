<p> In this century of institutional development, national expansion, and sectional conflict, Americans continued to define a national identity.

They also analyze how geographical expansion and ideas of progress influenced different visions and versions of America. Topics and texts range from Transcendentalist writers, the Second Great Awakening, and <i>Black Elk Speaks</i> to landscape painting and Western photography. Prerequisite: American Conversations 101. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts towards American studies major. </p>
