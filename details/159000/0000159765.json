		"What is a scandal? A literary scandal breaks out when an author goes against accepted (cultural or aesthetic) norms causing outrage and controversy. Whether settling personal scores, exploring \"dangerous\" new ideas or forms, or attacking the status quo, nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Russian authors and literary critics were often at the center of explosive scandals that gripped the attention of the educated public. In this course, we will explore scandals of many different natures and discover what they can teach us about Russian literature and culture of the period. We will read both familiar and lesser-known works: authors span from Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy to Leskov, Tur, Kuzmin and Sologub. Topics include queerness, heresy, revolt, women writers, normativity and deviancy. Taught in English."
