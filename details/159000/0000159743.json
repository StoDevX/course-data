		"This course explores the development of Native American societies in the North American west, beginning with the first migrations to the area more than ten-thousand years ago, and ending with Lewis & Clark's famous voyage. The subject is vast; topics include the ancient Pueblo communities, Spanish reconnaissance and colonization of New Mexico, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the contribution of horses and guns to the development of Plains Indian culture, Native life in the Spanish missions in Alta California, as well as early trade in the Pacific Northwest. Our investigations will include recent prize-winning books on these topics and feature archaeology as a method for reconstructing early history. Along with Native oral traditions, students read first-hand accounts by early Spanish, British, French, and even Russian explorers who preceded Lewis and Clark to the American West."
