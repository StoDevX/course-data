		"Magic, Sorcery and Witchcraft in the Ancient Mediterranean World explores the social, ritual, and ideological contexts of magic and its articulation from 3500 BCE through the 600 century CE throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.  Starting in Sumeria, students will use critical religious and cultural theory to analyse ancient and modern conceptions of magic from Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Hebraic Kingdoms, Greece and Rome. As a methods seminar for the History major, this course will examine the wider historiographic context of witchcraft and magic studies, recent critical scholarship on Mediterranean magic, and the extant primary sources."
