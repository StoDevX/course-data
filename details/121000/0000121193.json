		"This course will center around the Swedish system of manual training known as \"sloyd\" which means \"craft\" or \"hand skills.\" The method, developed in the 19th c., encouraged students to systematically develop hand skills (usually woodworking) along with an understanding of tools, materials, processes and a sense of care and commitment to excellence. It teaches the \"whole person\" Â– the development of character and intellectual capacity as well as skill building. Summer Sloyd students will use the sloyd knife, draw knife, axe, brace, and hand saws (as well as some power tools) to explore the intersection of handwork, woodwork, and creativity. Projects will center around basic woodworking skills, green woodworking, history of functional woodenware in Nordic countries, and natural finishing/surface design techniques."
