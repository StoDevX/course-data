	BIO 398L: Independent Research
	(2016-2017, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Independent research is offered for students dedicated to an in-depth research experience. In conjunction with a faculty supervisor, a student conceives and performs a research project leading to the production of a major piece of work such as a research paper or poster presentation. Independent research requires permission of a supervisor and completion of an independent research form available at the Registrar's Office or its Web site. </p>
