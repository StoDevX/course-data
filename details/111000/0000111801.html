	MUSIC 136: American Popular Music through the Lens of Prince
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> At the beginning of Prince's career, this prolific Minnesotan drew on a breadth of genres unprecedented for a popular musician in America. His live performances in particular present a sonic history of American popular music since the mid-20th century. Beginning from specific pieces, the class performs an archeology of 20th- and early 21st-century music to consider genres (including blues, soul, R&amp;B;, funk, and rock) and issues in music technology, spirituality, gender, sexuality and race. Counts toward music, American studies, race and ethnic studies, women's and gender studies majors; and race and ethnic studies and women's and gender studies concentrations. Offered occasionally. </p>
