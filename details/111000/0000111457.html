	(2016-2017, Interim)

<p>This seminar course will focus on things in the environment that a mother may be exposed to during pregnancy that affect fetal development. We will discuss the mechanisms by which teratogens increase the chance of having a baby born with a birth defect. Teratogens discussed will include radiation, drugs, alcohol, stress and infections such as that caused by the Zika virus. This is a discussion-based course that will rely heavily on the primary literature. Prerequisite: two 200-level BIO courses or permission of instructor. </p>
