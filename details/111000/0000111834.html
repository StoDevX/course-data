	ART 275: Topics in Art History
	(2016-2017, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p>The museum field is broad and inherently interdisciplinary, incorporating a range of topics including artistic, cultural, ethical, financial and legal questions. Students explore these issues and learn about the practicalities of a range of museum departments and jobs, including collections management and care, curation, development, and education. The class will work with objects in the Flaten Museum collection. </p>
