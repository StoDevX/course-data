	PSYCH 229: Psychology of Spirituality and Religion
	(2016-2017, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Spiritual and religious experience and practices are human activities that can be investigated with psychological methods and theories. To do so faithfully, one must deal with the tension between scientifically understanding something and explaining it away. Students review the large multidisciplinary literature in this area. They also explore the religion/science tension by reporting on current news items and by participating in a chosen private spiritual practice (e.g. meditation) and systematically analyzing the experience. Offered periodically. Prerequisites: PSYCH 125 and BTS-B, or permission of the instructor. </p>
