		"This seminar explores art and material culture to research ecocritical artistic themes such as the roles and concerns raised by art and environmental activism; what ecocriticism reveals about landscapes and environmental matters in specific places and times, and how indigenous peoples' environmental concerns are explored through art. The course counts as an environmental studies, arts and humanities elective, an American studies course, and as an art history course within the art history and studio art majors."
