	ENGL 280: Topics in Genre
	(2017-2018, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>Through literature, film and theory, this course will highlight important questions about the politics and social dynamics of queer sexuality and gender and how some of the most interesting contemporary writers and artists explore these questions in their work. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which sexual identities intersect with and shape other categories of identity including gender, ethnicity, class culture and nation. Our work together will work toward several goals: 1) to understand a literary works queerness in terms of form and style; 2) to gain a sense of the central concepts and debates in queer theory and politics; and 3) to apply theory to literature as well as real world issues. GE: ALS-L. Prerequisites: FYW or equivalent. </p>
