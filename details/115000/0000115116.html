	LATIN 373: Lucretius and Latin Poetry
	(2017-2018, Semester 1)

<p> Lucretius might best be described as a philosophical poet. His <i>De Rerum Natura</i> ("On the Nature of the Universe") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating poem. Offered periodically. Counts toward ancient studies and medieval studies majors. Prerequisite: LATIN 231 or equivalent. </p>
