		"The Mongol conquests of Asia in the 13th and 14th centuries shook the settled world to its core, leaving death and destruction in its wake. But what did life in medieval Asia look like after the Mongols? This course examines medieval Asian societies and their visitors as they dealt with and adapted to what some Europeans thought was the coming of the apocalypse. While Europe never experienced the doomsday they feared, many other countries in Asia had to engage directly with them, changing their societies forever. To get a look at how these societies adapted and how such a devastating conquest could end up opening super-long-distance trade routes, this class will read, Chinese, Japanese, Muslim, and European travel writing as well as other primary and secondary sources that examine what life was like after the Mongols assembled the biggest land empire in human history."
