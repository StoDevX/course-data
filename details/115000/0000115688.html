	NORW 246: Edvard Munch and Nordic Literature
	(2016-2017, Summer Session 1)
	</p>
<p> The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch not only painted one of the world's most famous paintings ("The Scream"), he also produced a remarkable body of psychological and expressionist artworks from the 1880s to the 1930s. This course uses Munch's art as a window onto Nordic literature in a period of transition from naturalism to modernism. Students explore the work of writers with significant connections to Munch, investigating the interplay between art and literature in fin-de-siècle Scandivavia. Counts toward Norwegian major and Nordic studies concentration. Offered periodically. </p>
