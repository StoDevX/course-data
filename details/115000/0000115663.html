<p>Populismdefined as the people versus the interestshas a central role in American politics and culture. The 2016 election featured right and left populisms. With roots in contests over democracy, notably the 19th-century Peoples Party, populist movements have produced egalitarian and xenophobic politics, both yesterday and today. Populist culture ranges from Aaron Coplands music to reality TV. This course explores these many varieties of populism, while placing American populism in a global context. </p>
