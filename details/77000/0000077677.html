A minimum of 80 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment (an Interim or its equivalent) is required prior to student teaching. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: Education 170: <i>Urban Schools and Communities</i>; Education 347: <i>Teaching English as a Second</i> <i>Language</i>; Education 378: <i>Multicultural Education in Hawaii</i>; Education 379: <i>Urban Education Seminar and Practicum</i>; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools with special cognitive component.
