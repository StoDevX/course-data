	HIST 169: The Western Home: Stories of Norwegian America
	(2011-2012, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Norwegian folklore tells of a place east of the moon and west of the sun where dreams are realized. For hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Norway this fabled place was America. They called it, as does St. Olaf's own college hymn, <i>Fram, Fram</i>, "a home in the west." This course explores the stories of Norwegian America through its literature and other forms of popular writing created from the 19th through the 21st centuries. It considers, among other forms, novels, shorts stories, drama, children's literature, memoirs, letters, diaries, travel accounts, biographies, journalism, popular history, and film. Offered alternate years. </p>
