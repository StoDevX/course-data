	PHIL 259: Global Health Ethics
	(2011-2012, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This seminar seeks a culturally respectful ethical framework for developing health policies for our increasingly interdependent world, a world of widening disparities in wealth and health. In relation to issues of health, how might relationships between individuals, institutions, and nations be structured to reduce injustice and improve prospects for well-being, peace, and security? How might different cultural, political, and industrial conditions around the world affect our western conception of bioethics? Prerequisite: BTS-T or consent of instructor. Offered periodically. Counts towards philosophy major. </p>
