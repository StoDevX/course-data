	IS 214: Top: Music in Film
	(2011-2012, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Igor Stravinsky said that film music should have "the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading." In this seminar, students encounter an art that can have devastating emotional impact while often remaining unnoticed. Students achieve a broad understanding of the history of music in cinema and create new film music in team-based collaborations. No music background or other prerequisites required. </p>
