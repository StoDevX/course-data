	(2011-2012, Interim)

<p> This course investigates three essential questions: How do we reliably measure something? How do we design valid research? How do we analyze research results? Topics include ANOVA designs (e.g., interaction crossing and/or nesting groups), data reduction methods, and principles of measurement. Interdisciplinary groups will work together throughout the term. These teams will teach a design topic during the last week of class. Prerequisites: Statistics 110 or 212 or 263 and either Psychology 230, Education 290, Sociology/Anthropology 371, or permission of the instructor. </p>
