	LATIN 373: Lucretius and Latin Poetry
	(2011-2012, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Lucretius might best be described as a philosophical poet. His <i>De Rerum Natura</i> ("On the Nature of the Universe") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating poem. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent. Offered every third year. </p>
