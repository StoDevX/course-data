	PSYCH 222: Psychology of Hearing
	(2011-2012, Interim)
	</p>
<p> How do we hear? What do we hear? How do we know? This course examines the perception of the acoustic world through our sense of hearing. Topics include the structure of sound itself (acoustics), how sound is encoded and processed by the brain, and how we come to understand sound as something beyond a physical stimulus (representation, meaning, and interpretation). Additional topics include speech perception, music, hearing loss, and cochlear implants. Prerequisite: Psychology 125 recommended. Offered during Interim. </p>
