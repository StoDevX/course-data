<p> An in-depth look at how musical conventions, styles, and forms of music convey drama, emotion, and meaning in dance, opera, musical theater, and film.

Intended for non-music majors, the course covers basic listening skills and vocabulary for description and analysis. Offered during Interim. </p>
