The course considers Christian teachings about God and Jesus, biblical interpretation, worship, response to social, political,, and cultural practices through encounters between Indian Christians and other churches. The multiple religions of India, its colonial experience, and its contemporary society are essential context. Prerequisite: BTS-B. </p>
