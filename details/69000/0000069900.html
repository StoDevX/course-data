	REL 270: Old Testament/Hebrew Bible
	(2009-2010, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course examines the faith of Israel in the God of the covenant and how the covenant faith was shaped in the community of Israel and expressed in its literature. Students examine two forms of travel: traditional Buddhist pilgrimages, and modern forms of tourism. The course explores Buddhist and Christian forms of pilgrimage, comparing their motivations, practices, and consequences in relation to each tradition's ethical ideals. Tourism raises ethical issues, including economic justice, environmental impact, sustainability, and the quality of interactions between tourists and local cultures. Prerequisite: BTS-B. </p>
