	ASIAN 310: Buddhism through Text and Image
	(2009-2010, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This course examines Buddhist images and their relationship to textual sources. Beginning with a close reading of Buddhist texts in translation, students study how Buddhist images and architecture derive from textual sources -- and often move beyond them. The course considers the interrelatedness of text and image in Buddhist practice. Attention is also paid to Western notions of Buddhism and the development of Buddhist art studies in the West. </p>
