	REL 234: Luther and Aquinas: Protestant and Catholic Theology in Dialogue
	(2009-2010, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> The theologies of Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther influence the lives and beliefs of Catholics and Protestants, yet cause persistent division between them. Students examine the distinctive theological contributions of the two theologians, particularly their respective doctrines of justification, sacraments, and God. Students interpret and evaluate each theologian's doctrines as well as modern efforts to reconcile their differences. Offered annually or in alternate years. </p>
