	ENGL 280A: Shakespeare and His Contemporaries
	(2009-2010, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Students examine a limited number of plays (eight or nine) in order to concentrate on how to read the plays well and how to respond fully to both text and performance. Students attend live performances when possible and view productions on video. The course, designed especially for non-majors, includes some consideration of historical context and background as well as practice in how to write about the plays. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. </p>
