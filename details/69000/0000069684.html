	ENGL 395: Chaucer from an Ethical Perspective
	(2009-2010, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Students analyze from a broadly cultural view the political, religious, and intellectual debates of Chaucer's day as reflected in his greatest work, the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>. Students examine the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> through the lens of ethics, using readings in ethical theory to better understand moral questions, Chaucer's poetry, and ourselves -- as interpreters of literature and moral agents. Prerequisite: English 185 plus one course of relevant background; completion of BTS-T. </p>
