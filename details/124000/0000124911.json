		"This course extends important ideas of single-variable calculus (derivatives, integrals,",
		"graphs, approximation, optimization, fundamental theorems, etc.) to higher-dimensional",
		"settings. These extensions make calculus tools far more powerful in modeling the",
		"(multi-dimensional) real world. Topics include partial derivatives, multiple integrals,",
		"transformations, Jacobians, line and surface integrals, and the fundamental theorems of",
		"Green, Stokes, and Gauss. Offered each semester. Prerequisites: MATH 126 or MATH 128, and",
