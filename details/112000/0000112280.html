<p> "To be or not to be" is only one of many ethical questions raised by dramatists writing in English, from medieval moralities to postmodern plays. Using a framework of readings from classical and contemporary ethical theories, students examine moral and ethical conflicts within plays from several periods. The course also addresses the works in their cultural and theatrical contexts; students attend a performance of one play on the syllabus. Counts toward English major. Offered alternate years. Ticket fee required. Prerequisites: BTS-T and ENGL 185 plus at least two English courses at level II, or permission of instructor. </p>
