		"Living and dying: Explorations with young adults: The death rate is 100%. Yet conversations about how and where we die are the most important ones we are not having. This Directed Undergraduate Research course will examine and produce culturally appropriate tools and resources for teaching young adults about how to have conversations about dying and end of life. When and how we have such conversations can affect how we live in families and communities. Students will explore issues and resources through multidisciplinary lenses. Required background: Coursework in statistics and research methods in at least one of: economics, education, nursing, political science, psychology, sociology/anthropology, or social work. Preference given to students with deep interest in college students and death, dying, advance care planning, and related subjects."
