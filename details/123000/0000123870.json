		"We will consider contemporary and enduring questions relating to aging from many different perspectives: biological, psychological, social, economic, ethical, technological and political factors that relate to aging. Questions we will address include: What changes do people experience as they age, and how can societal institutions best serve this population given evolving population trends? What role should older adults play in society? How should end-of-life be handled?"
