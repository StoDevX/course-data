		"Were the Middle Ages white? Popular culture would often have you think so, depicting a world that is almost completely racialized as white, save for the occasional exotic visitor. This seminar course seeks to dispel that image, and assert that the western European Middle Ages was a highly permeable culture whose art was shaped by interactions with cultures in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, whether through trade, the exchange of ideas, or violent conquest."
