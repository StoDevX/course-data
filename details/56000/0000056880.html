	HIST 397: Senior Thesis Seminar
	(2007-2008, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This capstone seminar is open to all history majors for independent research and discussion of historical issues. Although it serves all majors, it is also appropriate for those writing a paper for consideration for distinction. With the consent of the instructors, students may complete a research project that satisfies the requirements of the thesis seminar and another Level III seminar. </p>
