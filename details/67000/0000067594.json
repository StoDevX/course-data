		"some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media projects and services rather than",
		"conscientious and socially minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a",
		"comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped,",
		"and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development",
		"of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical",
