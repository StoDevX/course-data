	MATH 356: Geometry
	(2007-2008, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Properties of axiomatic systems are illustrated with finite geometries and applied in a synthetic examination of Euclid's original postulates, well-known Euclidean theorems and non-Euclidean geometries. Euclidean, similarity and affine transformations are studied analytically. These transformations are generalized to obtain results in projective geometry or used to generate fractals in an exploration of fractal geometry. Dynamic geometry software and hands-on labs are used to explore both the transformations and properties of these geometries. Prerequisite: Mathematics 220 and 244 or 252. Offered during Interim. </p>
