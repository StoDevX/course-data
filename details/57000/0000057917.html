	PHIL 256A: Friendship, Love, and the Good Life
	(2007-2008, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Moral issues concerning friendship and love are analyzed from the perspective of normative moral theories and various theories of value. Issues may include the role of friendship in the moral life, exploitative versus fulfilling relationships, and the conflict between altruism and self-love. Since loving is itself a form of valuing, value theory is approached by investigating philosophical and theological works concerning the basic types of love: <i>philia</i>, <i>eros</i>, and <i>agape</i>. Prerequisite: completion of BTS-T. Offered most years. </p>
