		"In this seminar, we will investigate issues of meter and rhythm in cross-cultural (and inter-generic) music and think about the ways in which music analysis can help us understand cultural exchange. We will situate our musicological activities within a postcolonial literature to ask how the legacy of colonialism and Euro-American elitism affected the musicÂ’s production, consumption, and representation.   In the week-to-week classroom, we will primarily explore inter-generic jazz fusions (such as jazz + West African music, jazz + Indian classical music, jazz + rap/hip-hop, etc.) through a series of reading, listening, and analysis assignments. Students will have the opportunity to pick any sort of cross-cultural music for their final projects, which will be conference-style presentations that include both music analytical and primary/secondary source-based musicological components.\""
