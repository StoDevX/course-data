	IS 204: Ethics and Global Service
	(2012-2013, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> Orphans, HIV/AIDS, abuse, poverty: many Oles want to address these global issues directly. Students study and apply ethical reasoning to decisions about serving abroad. Vocations of service invite the examination of motivation, values, needs, faith stances, and privilege. Through the lenses of Christian, multicultural, and feminist ethics and concepts of vocation, students sharpen their thinking about "helping" in another cultural context. Designed particularly for students interested in global careers in health, ministry, social welfare, education, and community development. Open to juniors and seniors from any major. Prerequisite: Completion of BTS-T, or permission of instructor. </p>
