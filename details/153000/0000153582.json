		"It's easy to fall into a political discussion with friends, family, and even strangers. It's perhaps just as easy to feel overwhelmed, angry, and out of one's comfort area. This course will help you develop and sharpen the skills required for disagreement, learning, and learn about learning. We'll discover political psychology, research high-quality sources, and critically evaluate what it means to talk about politics, and how we can all improve and grow from doing so--in our knowledge, empathy, and democratic citizenship."
