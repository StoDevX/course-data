		"From our location in Northfield, the Holocaust happened \"over there\" in Europe but this event reached all corners of the world (except for the penguins in Antarctica). How did the Nazis' policies of political and racial exclusion come to reality inside and outside of Germany? How did the world --  including the United States and Latin American countries -- respond? In this course, we will explore how the Nazis rose to power, transformed a bureaucracy with welfare state underpinnings, and revived Germany's glory of territorial conquest. Then we move to investigate the state-sponsored murder of millions of Jews and non-Jews by the Nazis and their many collaborators during the war in Europe. Meanwhile we will consider local treatment of Jewish refugees in Africa and Asia. Throughout the semester, we will study the individuals, institutions, historical events, and ideologies that allowed for the Holocaust to occur and remain in our collective memory."
