	MATH 118: Gateways: Geometric Patterns in Islamic Culture
	(2008-2009, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> In this mathematical exploration of the geometry underlying the patterns and images of Islamic art and architecture, students encounter the origins of patterns found in Islamic religious beliefs and the development over time of this expression of mathematics through culture. They study and analyze examples occurring in the architecture of buildings and monuments found in the Islamic world. Students apply the acquired geometry and Islamic culture by creating new original patterns and defending them as appropriate representations of Islamic decoration. Offered Spring Semester. </p>
