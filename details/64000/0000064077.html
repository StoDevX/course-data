	REL 344: Feminist Perspectives and Christian Ethics
	(2008-2009, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> How might the Christian ethical systems which have dominated western culture look different if women's experiences and perspectives had been more centrally included? This course focuses on the continuities and contrasts between traditional Jewish and Christian ethics and the feminist and womanist ethical challenges to them which have emerged over the last quarter century. Prerequisite: completion of BTS-B and BTS-T. </p>
