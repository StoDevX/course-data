	HIST 241: HIstorical Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in Latin America
	(2008-2009, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This course examines issues of race and ethnicity in Latin America from colonial times to the present. Although not directly comparative, by highlighting the region's distinctive tradition of racial mixture the course provides students with a model of race relations that contrasts sharply with that of the U.S. The course also concerns changing ideas about race in Latin America and the impact of these ideas on debates over national identity. Offered periodically. </p>
