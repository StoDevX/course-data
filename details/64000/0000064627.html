	BIO 288: Equatorial Biology (abroad)
	(2008-2009, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Equatorial Biology offers intensive field-biology experiences within three equatorial New World environments: the Amazon rainforest, the Andes cloud forests and the Galapagos Islands. We will compare the rich biodiversity, the adaptations and natural history of species and the influence of human impact on these areas. Preparation for class requires readings from texts and primary literature concerning ecological and environmental issues specific to each of these regions. Based in Quito, the three field expeditions alternate with home-based rest days allowing for reflective writing in journals, assimilation and discussion. Prerequisite: Biology 125 and 126 or permission of instructor. </p>
