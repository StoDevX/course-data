Students analyze both journalistic criticism and theoretical texts, encompassing a wide variety of perspectives, and respond through short writing assignments and classroom discussion. Fee for field trip may be required. Prerequisite: at least one art history or studio art course, or permission of the instructor. Offered alternate years. </p>
