	ECON 117: Economics of Climate Change
	(2012-2013, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Climate change challenges standard models used in economics and requires people to rethink assumptions on the sources of economic growth. Although important questions remain in the science of climate change, markets are already adapting to future volatility, and nations spend large sums on emissions abatement. This course analyzes the impact of climate change on various economic systems, introducing relevant economic concepts including discount rates, risk analysis, equity and welfare, models of economic growth, and spatial analysis. Offered occasionally during Interim. </p>
