	HIST 117: Elizabethan England
	(2012-2013, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Why has the era of Elizabeth I remained so fascinating? Why did England emerge by 1603 as the major Protestant state of Europe with visions of overseas empire, a strong national culture, and a flourishing literature? Students examine relations between the monarchy and parliament, warfare with Spain, religious disagreements, Scotland and Mary Stuart, and the social order. Readings include historical writing, primary sources, and literature, with attention to several film treatments. Offered occasionally during Interim. </p>
