	ENGL 201: Transatlantic Anglophone Literature
	(2012-2013, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> This course considers Anglophone writing from Africa and the Caribbean. Linked by the slave trade and colonization, the drive for national independence, and the challenges of globalization, African and Caribbean writers have long been in dialogue. In order to provide a historical understanding of transatlantic Anglophone literature and an appreciation for its ongoing transformation, readings encompass influential works by established writers and contemporary works by emerging voices. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered in alternate years. </p>
