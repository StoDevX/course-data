		"College is one of the pivotal institutions in modern society, a place where significant cultural reproduction occurs. Campus life carries a high profile: admissions practices, curricular changes, and university events earn significant public attention. And yet the institution itself is difficult to understand, even to those in the midst of it. This is partly due to how we romanticize higher education, as well as to the system's immense complexity. This course is designed to explore how college works. We will examine the different tribes known as students, professors and staff, we will look at how they have developed over time, and we will analyze the problems and possibilities of American higher education."
