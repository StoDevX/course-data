		"In this course, students will analyze graphic novels and other visual narratives (graphic memoirs, journalism, and history, for example) through a literary lens to interrogate the possibilities, and limitations, of visual storytelling in the context of the English department. In addition to examining the form of the assigned works, students will consider questions of representation and accessibility in crafting graphic narratives. Which creators can, or should, represent whose stories, both visually and textually? Do images make graphic novels more widely understood than a strictly textual work? The goal of the course is not to answer these questions, but rather equip students with the requisite analytical skills to raise new questions about graphic narratives."
