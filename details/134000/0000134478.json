		"Trying to define \"comedy\" is deceptively difficult. While the first definition that comes to mind - anything that is humorous and makes the reader laugh - seems the clearest, it raises a host of questions. Are any topics universally funny? Can the genre apply to a work during which the reader never laughs? Do comedies offer a chance to engage more deeply with, or ignore, social issues? In this class, students analyze a variety of texts considered \"comedies\" - possibly including Arvind Adiga's <i>White Tiger,</i> Ralph Ellison's <i>Invisible Man,</i> and <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> - to explore the literary, social, and ethical debates in this slippery genre."
