	SWRK 261: Inclusive Practice: Groups, Organizations and Communities
	(2008-2009, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Social work majors continue the "how-to" of generalist practice. They assess strengths and problems of diverse groups, organizations and communities and use the systems perspective to help client systems frame goals and plans for social change. Students scientifically assess macrosystems and develop plans for implementing change that are reflective, scientific, just, and grounded in the liberal arts. Prerequisite: Social Work 254. Offered Spring Semester. </p>
