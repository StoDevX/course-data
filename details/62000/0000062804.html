	ECON 233: Economic Methods
	(2008-2009, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course develops the methodological framework which guides economic inquiry, while it reviews mathematical fundamentals and develops quantitative skills used in core courses of the major. Students learn to apply mathematical optimization to economic problems. See "Requirements of the Major" above for conditions under which this course may substitute for the required second mathematics course. Prerequisites: one of Economics 110-121 and Math 120, or its equivalent. Economics 233 does not count as a Level II economics analysis class toward the major. Offered annually. </p>
