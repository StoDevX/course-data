	ASIAN 127: Japanese Comics and War
	(2008-2009, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course consistsof two parallel sets of activities. First, students study the history of war in Japanese culture, with a focus on the Asian Pacific War (World War II, Pacific Theater). Second, as they study the war, students also "become" the people involved in the war, through a series of role playing exercises in which they develop their own characters from the 1945 Hiroshima and reconstruct the city of Hiroshima as it was then. </p>
