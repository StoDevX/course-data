		"The genre film often has a reputation as a lower or less artistically valid form of cinema, but scholarship in recent years has called for a reexamination of its status. Genre cinema leads contemporary scholars to reevaluate what were often presented as binary conflicts within film history and view them in a more nuanced light: the tension between cinema as mass medium versus higher art form; its reproduction of reality versus source of imaginative flight. Moreover, genre film has also long been associated with female-identifying filmmakers, as well as spectators. This identification has, of course, played into the filmsÂ’ status as outside of the traditional (white cishet male dominated) canon. The purpose of this course is to examine films outside of the traditional German cinema canon, as well as explore the conversations around and attitudes towards gender in the Germanophone world from the early twentieth century onwards."
