		"Illuminated manuscripts remain one of the most recognizable symbols of medieval culture. How were they made? What meanings did they hold for their viewers and readers? This course explores the aesthetic and material aspects of medieval books in their social and historical context, spanning Christian Europe and the Islamic world. Students will also have unique opportunities to examine medieval books in person, and to develop their own bookmaking skills, through class trips and hands-on activities."
