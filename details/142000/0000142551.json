		"Recent struggles for racial justice have reignited debates about how US history should be told. Do we have one cohesive history? Whose stories should we tell and why? Who gets to choose? This course explores these questions by analyzing recent attempts to create and present a national history. We examine the 1619 Project, which foregrounds the introduction of slavery to North America, the 1776 Project, which locates patriotism as an essential element of history education, and Educating for American Democracy, which emphasizes civic understanding. At its core, this course asks students to consider history as a space of conflict for the present and the future."
