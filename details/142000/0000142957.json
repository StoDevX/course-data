		"This course provides a comprehensive overview of cellular structure and function including",
		"cellular compartments, macromolecular structures, and life processes such as energy and material",
		"flux, cell division, and control mechanisms. Students learn current and/or historical evidence and",
		"methodology (e.g., microscopy, isolation procedures, and probes). Students attend lectures plus",
		"one three-hour laboratory per week. Laboratory experiences provide opportunities for qualitative",
		"and quantitative observations of cellular structure and function. Students place their work in the",
		"context of current research through examination of relevant literature and formal presentations.",
		"Offered each semester. Counts toward \"cell biology\" core category. Also counts toward biomolecular",
		"science and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisites: CHEM 121/CHEM 123, or CHEM 122, or CHEM",
		"125, or CH/BI 125; BIO 150 is strongly preferred."
