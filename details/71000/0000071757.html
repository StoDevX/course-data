	PSYCH 222: Psychology of Hearing
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> How do we hear? What do we hear? How do we know? This course will examine the perception of the world through our sense of hearing. Topics will range from the structure of sound itself (acoustics), how sound is encoded and processed by the brain, and how we come to understand sound as something beyond a physical stimulus (representation and interpretation). Additional topics will include speech perception, music, hearing loss, Deaf culture, and cochlear implants. Prerequisite: Psychology 125 recommended. </p>
