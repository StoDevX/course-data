	ENGL 253: Auth in English:Text/Contexts/Intertexts in The Fr Lieutenant's Woman
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course focuses on a single novel: John Fowles's 1969 <i>The French Lieutenant's Woman</i>, a bestseller that's also highly allusive postmodernist classic. After reading Fowles's novel, we will spend the term following up on its many references to and relationships with other texts - leading us to a wide range of writers and artists including Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Thomas Hardy, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Roland Barthes, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Hayden White, and Harold Pinter (who wrote the rather quirky 1981 film adaptation of the novel). Returning to <i>The French Lieutenant's</i> <i>Woman</i> after exploring this larger context of history, fiction, art, criticism, and theory, we will ask: What difference does this body of knowledge make in our experience of the novel? How does intertextuality - a text's network of relationships with other texts - work? We will also consider postmodernism and its take on history and intertextuality, ideas about the 'ideal reader' or 'implied audience,' sex and sexuality in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, and a deep twentieth-century fascination with the Victorian era. Pre-requisite: GE 111 or its equivalent. </p>
