	ENGL 248: Literature and Sport
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> Students read fiction, drama, poetry, and literary journalism in which sport plays an integral role. By focusing on this intersection between sports and literature, students develop a richer understanding of the ways in which literary texts critique and re-imagine popular culture. In addition to analyzing and interpreting literary texts, students develop their own critiques of comtemporary sports culture. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. Offered periodically. </p>
