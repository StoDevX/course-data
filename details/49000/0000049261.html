	(2005-2006, Semester 2)

This is a Norway that many 21st-century Norwegians would have a hard time recognizing. This course will focus on contemporary Norway, examining modern Norwegian society and politics against the background of tradition, looking at such issues as Norway as peace negotiator, its position as outsider in Europe and its evolving relationship to the United States.
