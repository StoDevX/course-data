	ENGL 264: Topics in Gender and Literature
	(2012-2013, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> This course investigates how literature--broadly writ--represents gender diversity and conformity and the issues associated with gender, such as: family, power dynamics, oppression, activism, domesticity, hierarchies, and inequalities. The texts of the course focus on a diversity of gendered identities by complicating the gender binary of "man" and "woman." A consideration of gender separated from other identities is limiting; therefore, this course examines how gender is embedded with race, class, ability, sexual orientation, technology, religion, and/or nationality. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alterate years. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term. </p>
