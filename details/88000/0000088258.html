	BIO 247: Animal Physiology
	(2013-2014, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p> How do animals do what they need to do to survive in all sorts of environments? Why are others able to exist in only very particular conditions? These are the sorts of questions students explore as they navigate the basic systems that provide circulation, ventilation, movement, digestion, and waste removal. Students look at how these processes are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts, in dark, deep oceans, and places in between. In the weekly three-hour lab, they conduct quantitative physiological measurements to assess functions such as temperature control, respiration rates, and salt and water balance. Prerequisites: Biology 150, or Biology 125 and 126, or Chemistry/Biology 125-227 and Biology 126. Counts as "comparative organismal biology" core category. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. </p>
