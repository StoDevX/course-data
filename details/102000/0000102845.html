<p> This course introduces students to the complicated relationship between philosophy and literature from any period between the 16th-century and the present day. Students learn about the intersection of ideas that fall under the general category of "modernity" and explore how selected philosophical views influence American and/or English literary works from the Renaissance to the contemporary period. Students gain an understanding of modern philosophies by learning how to incorporate interdisciplinary theories when engaging in literary analysis. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW. </p>
