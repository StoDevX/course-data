	WRIT 111D: First-Year Writing
	(2015-2016, Semester 1)
	</p>
<p>Food Writing: Adventures in Gastronomy - French writer Brillat-Savarin declares in The Physiology of Taste of 1848, Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are. American writer Mark Kurlansky insists in his 2002 Choice Cuts: A Savory Selection of Food Writing from around the World and throughout History, Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about mans relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. It is about memory and tradition and, at times, even about sex. Cooking, eating, and the representation of food as a topic of academic inquiry as well as one of enormous import in popular culture are the focus of this writing seminar. Through a number of formal and informal writing assignments students will explore the role of food in a variety of contexts such as literature, art, history, film, journalism and television. Texts and films may include Michael Pollans recent work of nonfiction Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, Emile Zolas nineteenth-century novel, The Belly of Paris, articles and essays by Roland Barthes, Wendell Berry, Michelle Obama, Margaret Mead, Barbarba Kingsolver, and Anthony Bourdain, as well as Gabriel Axels 1987 Danish movie, Babettes Feast. </p>
