	BIO 364: Molecular Biology
	(2015-2016, Semester 2)
	</p>
<p> Molecular biology techniques are bringing about a revolution in understanding living organisms. Students study the structure and function of macromolecules, methods currently used to clone and analyze genes, and new insights into basic biological processes which these methods provide. The course uses lecture and discussion topics with one project-oriented three-hour laboratory per week. Counts toward biomolecular science and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisite: BIO 233. </p>
