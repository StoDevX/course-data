<p>Dissolve it! Explode it! Twist it! Erode it! Are you a creative boundary breaker? Do you wish to see yourself that way? Develop your skills to collaborate, to make connections freely, to embrace ambiguity, to generate ideas, to improvise, to take risks and to learn from failure. Explore a range of physical and mental activities designed to develop creative confidence and intelligence -- all in the spirit of play while challenging your imagination and creative sensibilities. </p>
