		"This seminar draws from historical and contemporary concepts of gender as students explore and respond to the changing myths and realities of American masculinities. Students consider why, for example, men occupy close to 95% of CEO positions in U.S. Fortune 500 Companies while the number of fathers at home caring for children has doubled since 1989. In either case, what does it mean to be a man? The course explores how gender, race, sexual orientation, age, and other identity categories affect individual perception and performance of masculinities in context of work, intimate relationships, popular culture, sports, gaming, and mens movements. Texts may include The Mask You Live In, Masculinities in Theory, Performing American Masculinities, Talk Thai: The Adventures of Buddhist Boy, New Black Man, Rebel Without a Cause, and The Laramie Project. Participants are invited to bring additional interests to the writing and research components of this seminar."
