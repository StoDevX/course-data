		"Crusade and Jihad examines a fascinating series of political, military, spiritual, and commercial processes that spanned the entirety of the late European medieval and early modern periods, and whose legacy endures to the present day. The primary aim of the course is to study the crusading phenomenon in its medieval context by engaging with some of the most important documentary remains of the period. Students will be encouraged to ask and consider questions based on their engagement with the medieval minds who created these texts."
