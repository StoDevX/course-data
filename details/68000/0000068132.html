	CH/BI 126: Integrated Chem/Bio II: Thermodynamics and Kinetics with Bio Relevance
	(2009-2010, Interim)
	</p>
<p> This course introduces physical chemistry with an emphasis on thermodynamics and kinetics of biologically relevant systems. Topics include probability as the driving force for chemical reactions; the relationship between chemical bonding energetics, entropy, and equilibria; oxidation-reduction reactions and electrochemistry; and rates of reactions, including enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Laboratory experiments and activities illustrate lecture topics and introduce new concepts. Prerequisites: Chemistry/Biology 125 and Math 120 or 121. Offered during Interim. </p>
