		"Around the world, cultures from ancient to modern times have told stories of war, love, and magic. Epic literature has common features: characters like warriors, lovers, monsters, kings, and queens, showing qualities like courage and cowardice, faithfulness and duplicity. However, each epic tradition also captures distinctive aspects of its culture; often epic stories shape a national identity that persists through the ages. Students in this course read extracts of the Mesopotamian <i>Epic of Gilgamesh</i>, Greek <i>Osyssey</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>Beowulf</i>, Persian <i>Shahnameh</i>, and Indian <i>Ramayana</i>. Students analyze the anthropology of the texts and their implicit and explicit value claims, and study how epic is situated in socio-historical contexts and how genre shapes texts. Assignments include a photo essay, a class presentation, a research paper, and a reflection paper on this course as an example of liberal arts education."
