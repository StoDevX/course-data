		"Students trace and integrate the African American and Euro-American dance traditions of the late 19th century, 20th century, and early 21st century. The course focuses on the theatrical dance genres of: ballet, modern, and jazz (includes tap and some musical theater dance) and also examines social dance as the predecessor of some theatrical dance genres. The course also attends to the economic, religious, political, and social forces that have affected the development of dance in the United States, particularly race, ethnicity, and gender and the intersection with other forms of structured inequality. Video examples supplement reading, live dance viewing, physical exploration, class lecture, mid-term and final exams, writing assignments, and discussion. No dance experience required. Ticket/transportation fee required. Offered annually in the spring semester."
