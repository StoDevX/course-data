		"In this course students engage in discussions that go beneath binary discourse centered on Marxism and neoliberalism by turning to underlying debates related to morality and money. Students think about how societies determine value and how value comes to be reflected in coin, currency, and capital. Students investigate symbolism, sacred affection, fictions, and civil religion and read texts in a variety of disciplines including religious studies, anthropology, philosophy, sociology, economic history, and cultural studies. Offered annually in the spring semester."
