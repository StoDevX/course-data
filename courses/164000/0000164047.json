		"Flamenco is the collective protest of an oppressed people, a melting pot of musical influences, an oral tradition, a folkloric art, a fine art, and one of Spain's major cultural practices, globalized and marketed to the world as an expression of national identity. In this course, students study the history, theory, and practice of flamenco music in the region that produced it - Andalusia. Students also visit Madrid, exploring Spain's capital city and examining flamenco's influence on popular and classical music. Offered periodically during January term. Prerequisite: sophomore standing."
