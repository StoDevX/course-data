This course invites students to engage in self-reflection, topical discussions, capacity-building, and best professional practices for individual musicians in the performance industry. Topics include the basics of the music business (roles in the industry, copyright law and contracts), artist identity development, and practical skills for a musical career. Offered alternate years in the fall."
