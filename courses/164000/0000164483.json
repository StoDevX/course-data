		"This course is an introduction to the major figures, concepts, and debates in film and media theory (1915 to the present day). Although a historical framework informs the structure of this course, students are strongly encouraged to observe similarities and differences within the same schools of theory as well as across different theoretical models and periods. Topics of study include formative and realist film theory, psychoanalysis, semiotics, new and digital media, feminist media theory, and postmodernism. Offered annually in the spring semester beginning spring semester 2021-22. Prerequisite: FMS 101 or permission of instructor."
