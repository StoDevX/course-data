		"The software we design has real effects in people's lives. This course explores the ethical and social considerations inherent in computer-based systems, develops skills in thinking about those considerations and in collecting data to determine their effects, and expands students' abilities to integrate these issues and skills into software development procedures. Coursework uses case studies and surveys topics such as professional and ethical responsibilities, risk, liability, intellectual property, privacy, computer crime, and AI ethics. Offered each semester. Prerequisite: CSCI 251 or permission of instructor."
