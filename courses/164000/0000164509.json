		"This course explores how gender has shaped Jewish texts, ideas, and practices in a variety of historical contexts. Students consider how Jewish thinkers have understood - and sometimes worked to change - how gender operates in Jewish life and thought. Students use these thinkers as models for exploring how to think about ethical and religious questions using resources from a tradition of thought that they both learn from and critique. Offered periodically during spring semester."
