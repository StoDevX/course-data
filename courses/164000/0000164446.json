		"Ecospirituality asks how attention to distinct bioregions leads to a flourishing life. Amidst climate catastrophe, encountering wisdom across spiritual traditions helps students learn from place. This course focuses on Indigenous, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, and Spiritual-but-Not-Religious practices in rural and urban environments; amidst plains, forests, prairies; submerged in streams, bogs, and big water. While marrying region to practice, students use data collection, storytelling, ritual, hand arts, food, and music to reflect upon their own ecospirituality."
