		"Students learn, embody, and integrate elements of dance and film by engaging in the creative practice of making dance for the screen. Each student gains experience as a director, performer, videographer, editor, and critic in this collaborative learning community. Students discuss and analyze live movement studies, screen dances by peers and professionals, and relevant texts. Other technologies, such as 3D character animation and reactive/interactive technology, may be introduced. The class culminates with an evening public showing. Offered alternate years in the spring semester."
