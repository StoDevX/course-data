		"This course provides a sequential introduction to physical chemistry. Beginning with an introduction to statistical aspects of chemical equilibria, it explores the relationships between energy, entropy and equilibria (thermodynamics); oxidation-reduction reactions and electrochemistry; transitions between phases; and rates of reactions. Students attend three classes and one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually during spring semester. Prerequisite: CHEM 125, or CHEM 122, and concurrent or previous enrollment in MATH 119 or MATH 120, or permission of instructor."
