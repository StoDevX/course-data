		"Building on explorations in the Fall and January Term, this course will examine the following questions: What motivates and inspires human beings to nurture existing relationships with their environment and/or to seek a change in those relationships? What are strategies and actions for solving environmental challenges? What role will I play in Earth's future? (and in my community...). In navigating these questions, students will look through an interdisciplinary lens, engaging with a sustained research paper, creating art, and thinking about how we can take scholarship and personal explorations and translate them into civic engagement. This course is the third of a three-course Conversation Program. Prerequisites: ENCON 110 and ENCON 111."
