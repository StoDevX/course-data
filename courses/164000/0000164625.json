		"Students competing in intercollegiate athletics may use the season of participation in a varsity sport for 0.25 course credit in kinesiology. This 0.25 course can satisfy the Active Body graduation requirement. Only one 0.25 intercollegiate athletics course credit can be applied toward the 35.00 credits required for graduation. Fall: varsity football, soccer, cross-country, women's volleyball; spring: remainder of intercollegiate sports. Participants in club sports are not eligible for academic credit. Students must register for the course during the competitive season, not afterward."
