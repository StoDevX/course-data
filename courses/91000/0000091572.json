		"This course explores British literature of three eras, from Wordsworth to Woolf. Students begin with the romantic revolution of late 18th century, traverse the wide 19th-century span of Queen Victoria's reign, and cross into the modernist era following the cataclysm of World War I. Within each era, students examine a literary manifesto, a revolutionary event, an epic poem, a novel, and the aesthetics of the period. The course emphasizes conversations across eras and striking moments of \"making it new.\" Prerequisite: FYW. Offered periodically."
