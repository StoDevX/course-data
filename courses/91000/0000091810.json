		"Sitcom America is an interdisciplinary look at the television situation comedy as an art form, as a market-driven force, and as a reflection of aspects of American society since World War II. We will focus particularly on sitcom representations of family, the workplace, race, and gender and look at the ways technology and audience have altered the sitcom format over time."
