		"This course introduces students to the complicated relationship between philosophy and literature from any period between the 16th-century to the present day. Students learn about the intersection of ideas that fall under the general category of \"modernity\" and explore how selected philosophical views influence American and/or English literary works from the Renaissance to the contemporary period. Students gain an understanding of modern philosophies by learning how to incorporate interdisciplinary theories when engaging in literary analysis. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years."
