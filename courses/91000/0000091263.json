		"This course highlights major visual arts movements within China over the last century, from the end of the imperial era to current times. Students look at a variety of issues: class and gender; China in the world art market, Chinese art past and present, and a variety of \"isms\" now seen as defining Chinese art. A major theme is to define \"visual culture\" in all its nuances."
