		"Food holds a central place in many world religions. In their feasts and fasts, holy and forbidden foods, community suppers, festivals, and food shelves, people of faith develop and express their theologies. This course examines food beliefs and practices for religion, in particular the theological significance of food in Christianity and how it compares with other faith traditions. The relation of food to the doctrines of God, Christ, and salvation will have special attention. Prerequisite: BTS-B. Offered periodically during Interim."
