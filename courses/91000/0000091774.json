		"The study of the anatomy and physiology of the human body is founded on a thorough understanding of the structure and function of cells and tissues. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour lab per week. Nursing and exercise science majors may pre-register for this course. This course may not be taken after completion of Biology 125, Chemistry/Biology 227, or Biology 227, all of which serve as a prerequisite for Biology 243: Human Anatomy and Physiology. Offered in the fall semester."
