		"Twentieth-century thought across the political spectrum was critical of the modern state. Traditionalists and radicals alike were horrified by the rise of totalitarianism and the dangers of unrestrained political authority. In this course students engage with the works of leading critics of the state on both the Right (e.g. Hayek) and Left (e.g. Foucault), consider the similarities and differences of their critiques, explore the ethical consequences of the alternatives, and assess their contemporary relevance."
