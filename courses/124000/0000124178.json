		"Students enrolled in this lab course practice techniques of modern analytical chemistry using state-of-the-art instrumentation, including pH meters, liquid chromatographs, and a variety of spectrophotometers. Data acquisition via computer-interfaced instrumentation and electronic record-keeping is emphasized. Students practice and develop group skills by working in \"companies\" throughout the semester. P/N only. Offered each semester. Counts toward environmental studies major (all emphases) and concentration. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in CHEM 255."
