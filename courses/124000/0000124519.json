		"This course explores the Party Dances techniques that became known as \"Hip Hop\" in the 1980s. As a transformation of styles with Africanist parentage, this course focuses on the rhythm, groove, and complex footwork embedded by the New York beginnings of proper Hip Hop. Students learn about its nuanced social politics and investigate the influence of Hip Hop on various cultures through the study of Party Dances and styles from New York to California. P/N only. Offered each semester."
