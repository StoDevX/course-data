		"This course examines the relationship of psychoanalysis to critical social theory. Students are introduced to classic psychoanalytic texts and works in critical theory that creatively take up or challenge them. Students are encouraged to develop their own perspectives on ethical issues surrounding human subjectivity, gender and sexuality, race and coloniality, and the possibility of progress -- as well as debates about psychoanalysis as an agent of oppressive normalization versus a force for liberatory social change. Offered periodically in January term. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
