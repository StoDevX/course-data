	"description": [
		"Using methods from public health and literary studies, students critically analyze the role of storytelling in medical encounters. In reflection papers and close-readings, students ask how memoir, film, and poetry highlight the layers of meaning and power dynamics that doctors and patients navigate. Students also volunteer with community partners to create quilts and bandages for hospitals and package them with other medical supplies, telling their own stories about the experience. Offered periodically in January term. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
