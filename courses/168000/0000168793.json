		"This praxis-based course is designed to empower students to develop a living definition of embodying activism when engaging with issues of race, power, privilege, and colonialism. Through multiple social justice perspectives, student activists define their own understanding of activism and discern how to participate in various forms of activism within a hybrid course that combines seminars, lectures, and studio practices. Student activists, centered on their living definition of Embodying Activism, interact with other activists, artivists, philosophies, and diverse techniques that prioritize embodiment as their primary method of inquiry within the United States. Having a performative background is strongly encouraged but is not a prerequisite."
