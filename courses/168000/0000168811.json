		"The field of kinesiology is constantly expanding into new frontiers. This course provides an in-depth study of advanced topics that are chosen with attention to student interest and available staff. Class work depends on the topics and instructor, but is consistent with the amount and level of work in other 200-level kinesiology courses. May be repeated if courses are different. Counts as an elective toward the kinesiology major. May count toward other majors or concentrations if approved by the chair of that major/concentration. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor."
