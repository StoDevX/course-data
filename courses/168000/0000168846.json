		"Why are the 1960s considered the \"decade of the big change\"? The era was one of global upheaval, political realignment, and cultural transformation. Through historical sources, film, literature, and media, students will explore how the decade reshaped ideas about power, identity, and protest across the U.S. and the wider world. The course emphasizes both a transnational historical context and collective memory, equipping students to analyze competing interpretations and consider the period's enduring influence. Offered periodically in spring semester."
