		"From classical form to avant garde, this course introduces students to the various artistic representations of Asian calligraphy. Students explore the aesthetic concepts, evolution of different styles, and practical techniques of brush-written writings. Class lectures complement hands-on practice in which students master the basic strokes, structures, compositions, and movements that are involved in producing calligraphic work. Asian language knowledge is not required. All readings and demonstrations will be in English. Materials fee. Offered periodically."
