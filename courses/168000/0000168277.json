		"The American presidency is one of the most powerful political offices in the world. The actions and policies of U.S. presidents influence domestic governance, global affairs, and democratic institutions. This course examines the presidency's powers, constraints, and responsibilities, exploring the political processes that shape it. We analyze contemporary developments and historical trends, addressing key questions about nominations, institutional evolution, personal leadership, and the impact of social and economic forces, with a focus on the 21st-century presidency. Offered annually during spring semester."
