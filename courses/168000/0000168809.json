		"This course introduces students to the study of physiological and functional adaptations to human movement. The field is richly interdisciplinary, involving such disciplines as anatomy, chemistry, biology, physics, physiology, biomechanics, motor control, psychology, nutrition, neuroscience, rehabilitative therapy, and exercise prescription. Rigorous and systematic study of these sub-fields enables students to understand how and why people move and the factors which limit and enhance the capacity to move. Offered annually."
