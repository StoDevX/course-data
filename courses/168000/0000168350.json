		"This course considers masterworks of Russian and Soviet cinema that were directed by women. In what subtle and/or overt ways did being socialized as a woman affect a director's perspective? In what subtle and/or overt ways are the challenges that women faced in the USSR and in contemporary Russia reflected in their films? Topics include basic cinema analysis, Russian cinema criticism, Russian film theory, and gender theory."
