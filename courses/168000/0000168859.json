		"This course introduces students to literary journalism, a tradition of in-depth nonfiction writing that reveals society's untold stories. Together, students discuss genre-defining texts from Joan Didion to The New Yorker. Students follow a slow journalism model used by magazine editorial departments, practicing investigative newsgathering using databases, public records, visual media, and interviews. Through deep work with sentence-craft, they develop a publishable longform article (or several shorter, linked works) in an area of their particular interest. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
