		"This course examines the long standing habit in Russia of depicting its Muslim neighbors, and citizens, as Orientalized Others and/or enemies. Students look at texts spanning more than a thousand years of Russian and Eurasian history, to examine the figure of the Muslim in the Russian literary imaginary. In so doing, students gain a sense for the ever-changing relations between Christian and Muslim communities in Eurasia through the lens of their interactions in literature. Offered periodically."
