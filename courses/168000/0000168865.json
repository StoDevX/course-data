		"This course begins with a brief historical examination of the period from Abraham, whose \"many sons\" include both the Jews and the Arabs, through the Ottoman collapse and Mandatory Period to World War II. The chronology then slows and focuses primarily on the developments in the Middle East that have led to the current Palestinian Israeli crisis. Underlying this chronological structure, specific themes will be emphasized in each class, along with overarching themes like the roles of imperialism, nationalism, religion, and victimhood narratives. Offered periodically in spring semester."
