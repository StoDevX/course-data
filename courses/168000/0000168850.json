		"What might it mean to live authentically? From social media to personal branding, authenticity is a common ethical concept, one oriented towards autonomy and self-realization. Yet, authenticity has a diversity of meanings, whether religious or non-religious. This course will explore authenticity by putting Luther, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche into conversation with ideas of authenticity. Exploring themes such as divine action, freedom, sin, passion, and will to power, the class will interrogate the (im)possibility of becoming authentic. Offered periodically in spring semester."
