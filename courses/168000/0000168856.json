		"This course examines the relationship between literature as a form of cultural expression and capitalism as a mode of economic production. Understanding literature's response to capitalism requires interdisciplinary study. This course thus seeks to contextualize the transformations of literature and capitalism by reading in the fields of political economy, sociology, political theory, critical race studies, advertising and marketing, visual art, and film. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
