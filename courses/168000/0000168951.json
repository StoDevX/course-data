		"This course explores how Jewish communities and scholars in Jewish studies have understood Jewish reproductive ethics. The course introduces students to a range of Jewish approaches to issues including abortion, IVF, surrogacy, and reproductive decision-making. It also explores how American Jews have negotiated reproductive rights claims in the wake of the Dobbs decision. Students consider material that uses a variety of methods, including ethnographies, philosophical studies, legal arguments, and graphic novels."
