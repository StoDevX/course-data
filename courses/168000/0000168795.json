		"Have you ever wondered why exercise makes your tissues stronger? This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles governing the structure and adaptation of the musculoskeletal system. We will explore how physical forces influence the health and function of our most critical tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, and muscle. The curriculum will bridge the gap between cellular mechanisms (known as mechanobiology) and whole-body function, demonstrating how an understanding of mechanical loading can optimize performance and accelerate recovery. This is a foundational course perfect for those in physical science majors and/or considering careers in the rehabilitation sciences, medicine, or fitness."
