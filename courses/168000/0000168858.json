	"description": [
		"This course surveys traditions of writing about disability and the body in genres like fiction, memoir, journalism, manifesto, and diagnostic manual. Focus is given to neurodevelopmental conditions, physical impairments, and age-related debility. Through critical discussion of texts, students examine how somatic, bodily experience arises through encounters with human infrastructure and nonhuman ecology. Students also experiment with accessibility, usability, and emancipatory design to translate their own bodily perceptions into public essays, visualizations, and other digital media. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
