		"Artificial intelligence is an extremely broad field in which the overarching goal is the creation of an autonomous agent with human-level capabilities. Students study the fundamental algorithms and techniques used to create agents with varying degrees of autonomy and function, including search algorithms, first-order logic, Bayesian networks and simple neural networks. Students learn how to represent problems for specific techniques, and how to select the best technique for a given problem. Offered annually. Prerequisites: CSCI 251 and MATH 234, or permission of instructor."
