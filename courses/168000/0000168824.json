		"Storytelling is one of the oldest forms of theology. For Indigenous peoples, stories are sacred, they carry wisdom, covenant, and encounters with the Holy. This course explores Indigenous narratives from diverse tribal nations as sacred texts in their own right. Through creation accounts, visionary experiences, trickster tales, and contemporary Indigenous literature, we will examine how stories embody theology: teachings about the divine, humanity, land, kinship, healing, and future hope. Students will engage these narratives with the same seriousness given to scripture in other traditions, reflecting on story as sacred practice, theological revelation, and communal memory."
