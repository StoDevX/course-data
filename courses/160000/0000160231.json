		"This course applies standard microeconomic theory and concepts to understand the law and the legal system. There are two primary approaches to \"Law and Economics.\" The first uses economics to understand how changes in legal rules affect human behavior. The second uses economics to explain the structure and variation of the legal rules themselves. This is an introductory course to the economics of law aimed at introducing students to both approaches. Offered annually. Prerequisite: one of ECON 110-121 or permission of the instructor."
