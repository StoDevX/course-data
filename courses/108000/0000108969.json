		"Solving complex environmental problems and generating creative work requires the integration and application of multiple ways of knowing. Team projects connected to community needs bring the department’s three areas of emphasis into conversation within an experiential learning framework. The course attends to the nature of environmental inquiry and creativity, one’s own perspectives and values, and how to use one’s knowledge and skills to contribute in personal, civic and work related roles. Course satisfies the experiential component requirement. Prerequisites: EnvSt 137, at least 1 course in two of the three areas of emphasis, and a declared EnvSt major or concentrator."
