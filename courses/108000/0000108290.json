		"RACE AND POWER. The presidential election of Barack Obama appeared to signal a new era of racial equality in the United States. However, race persists today as a system of power interlocked with class and gender as evidenced by the criminalization of black and brown communities and the fatal shootings of young men of color, as well as the ban on ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona, despite the curriculum's life-changing effects in students' lives. This seminar looks at texts related to these events and others in order to understand how race continues to hold force over our social realities. Students write short essays and a research paper to strengthen their writing processes while developing analytical language to name and interrogate race in the United States."
