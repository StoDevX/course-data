		"This class will examine contemporary psychological research, models, and theories of leadership. We will consider what comprises effective leadership, whether leadership can be learned, the role of personality, and the influence of culture and context . As part of our analysis, we will apply leadership models and theories to real-world leaders and critique their effectiveness. Students will be encouraged to explore their own leadership potential as they complete self assessments and participate in leadership exercises. Prerequisites: Psych 230 or permission of instructor."
