		"TELLING THE CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY. Climate change promises to be one of the most significant issues for the current and next generations. The challenges it provides--scientific, technical, economic, political and cultural--are monumental. And while climate change is truly a global issue, its effects will not be felt equally everywhere, nor will its costs (for both mitigation and adaptation) be proportionate to the ability of its victims to pay for them. In this seminar, we’ll explore the origins of the climate justice movement and its relationship to the environmental justice movements and we’ll examine strategies used by these social movements to envision and create a more egalitarian society framed on principles of social justice. Students write short essays and a research paper to strengthen their writing processes while developing the means to become active and effective advocates for change. (Open to Environmental Conversations students only.)"
