	"description": "This course builds on the principles learned in Chemistry/Biology 125/126 and explores how chemistry informs major principles of cellular and molecular biology. Topics include cell structure, metabolism, movement, signaling, and division. The course emphasizes problem-solving, quantitative reasoning, the scientific method, and scientific writing through lectures, discussions, readings, writing assignments, and lab work. Students attend three classe sand one three-hour laboratory each week. Counts toward \"cell biology\" core category for the Biology major. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: CH/BI 126.",
