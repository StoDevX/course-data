		"Social welfare policies exemplify how society's values and needs translate into policies and programs. Social workers create, implement, and evaluate policies in all areas of social policy. Students study policy formation and analysis that reflect interests and powers of diverse groups as well as economic and social realities of certain populations at risk of poverty and discrimination. The course emphasizes policy impact on women, people in poverty, people of color and the LGBT community, and empowerment in policy practice. Open to non-majors by permission of instructor. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward American studies major and management studies concentration."
