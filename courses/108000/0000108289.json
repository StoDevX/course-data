		"LANGUAGE MATTERS. Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it \u0093the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people\u0092s minds.\u0094 Language\u0097spoken, signed, and written\u0097is one of the most important ways we influence others and construct ourselves. This seminar is designed for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we may address include: how does our use of technology affect our language? how do advertisers manipulate language? why are \u0093bad words\u0094 bad? how is our language impacted by our place in a family, region, social class, etc.? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama show us how some writers have thought through these questions. We discuss these writers\u0092 ideas and the \u0093moves\u0094 they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience, and the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of your drafts. The class will read and attend a performance of a play; ticket and transportation costs will not exceed $25."
