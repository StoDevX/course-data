		"THE BIBLE AND SALVATION. Are the biblical messages of salvation truly “good news”? From images of personal healing to cosmic renewal, the Bible employs a surprising variety of metaphors to speak of God’s care and faithfulness toward God’s creation and covenant peoples. However, many have not found the church’s message of salvation to be “good news,” especially women, colonized peoples, and those concerned about our environment. Employing literary, historical, and cultural approaches to reading texts, in this course we will explore the rich diversity of biblical images of salvation and engage the concerns that critics have raised. We will also discuss ways theologians have utilized these biblical motifs to address specific cultures and contexts, with an eye toward identifying metaphors of salvation appropriate to our contemporary situations and mindful of modern challenges and concerns."

Students study major Biblical texts and their interaction with, for example, theology, religious practice, ethics, and social values, while considering methods and fields in the study of religion in a liberal arts setting. An additional prospectus describes the theme of each section."
