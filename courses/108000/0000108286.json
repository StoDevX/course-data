		"EXPRESSION, SOCIETY, AND THE ARTS. Wherein lies the power of creative expression? Why do societies and individuals both celebrate and fear it, perhaps fearing it so much at times as to attempt to limit or destroy it? This seminar considers the personal and communal value of the arts and of the creative expression at their core. Encountering artistic works from a variety of media, students and professor react, respond, probe, muse, and argue their way towards a deeper understanding of artistic impulse, human expression, and the occasional desire to quash both. Texts include Salman Rushdie\u0092s Haroun and the Sea of Stories, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, and Ice T's \"Cop Killer,\" among others."
