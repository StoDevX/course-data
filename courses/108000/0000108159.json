		"Students analyze from a broadly cultural view the political, religious, and intellectual debates of Chaucer's day as reflected in his greatest work, the Canterbury Tales. Students examine the Canterbury Tales through the lens of ethics, using readings in ethical theory to better understand moral questions, Chaucer's poetry, and ourselves -- as interpreters of literature and moral agents. Counts toward medieval studies major. Prerequisites: ENGL 185 plus at least two English courses at level II; completion of BTS-T; or permission of the instructor."
