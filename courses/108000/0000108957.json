	"description": [
		"United States history rises and falls through periods of prosperity and privation. During the years between the two 20th-century world wars, Americans dealt with economic expansion and depression, growing wealth and widening inequality. Using primary sources that include memoirs, oral histories, photographs, film, and government reports, students will investigate controversies over immigration, gender roles, Prohibition, labor organizing, the New Deal, and civil rights. Student will focus on how historians use and interpret different types of primary sources to create narratives about this period, while asking also how histories of the 1920s and 1930s shape our understanding of recent periods of prosperity and peril."
