		"Education Policy Analysis and Program Evaluation, Econ 399, will use economic theory and econometric analysis to examine key issues in education, including investment decisions, how education is produced and how it may influence long-term outcomes. One of the most important questions facing education economists is addressing gaps in academic achievement across various demographic groups. Using key methods from econometric analysis and program evaluation, this class will examine the root causes of the achievement gap, as well as analyze programs aimed at closing this gap."
