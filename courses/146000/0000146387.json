		"This course explores gender performance -- acts which historical subjects engaged in through bodily markers such as hair, clothing, posture, and voice, but also through relationships, labor, and domestic roles -- in East Asia during the long twentieth century. This expansive definition of gender includes new formations of gender identity and the body, such as the regional (and global) phenomena such as the New Woman/Modern Girl; East Asian masculinities and the \"Sick Man of Asia;\" women's oppression and liberation; changing divisions of labor; and changing understandings of transgender identities. Students read a selection of primary sources in translation and scholarly secondary sources, as well as produce a final research paper which focuses on gender in its many forms -- masculinities, femininities, and boundary-transgressing performances. This class takes as a matter of course that gender was a central aspect of human history and identity, but asks further, how was gender a major force that shaped, reoriented, and unsettled the path and futures of modern East Asia?"
