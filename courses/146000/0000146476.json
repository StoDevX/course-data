		"This course provides a comprehensive research opportunity, including an introduction to relevant background material, technical instruction, identification of a meaningful project, and data collection and analysis. The topic is determined by the faculty member in charge of the course and may relate to his/her research interests. This course does NOT meet the level III biology requirement for the biology major because it does not fulfill the Writing in the Major requirement. However, it can count as an elective for the biology major. Offered based on department decision. May be offered as a 1.00 credit course or .50 credit course. Prerequisite: determined by individual instructor."
