		"This course explores queerness, gender identity, and sexuality across Russia and the United States. We will explore the constructed, contested, and ambiguous nature of queer sexuality and its construction in Russian and U.S. popular culture, including literature, history, and film. Starting with basic theories in queer literature, we will explore how queer theory can be utilized to historically understand our contemporary views of gender and sexuality, formation of identity, as well approaches to LGBTQ+ rights in the the United States, Western Europe, and Russia. Rather than myopically understanding Russia and the U.S. as states historically hostile to queer rights, we will see how Russian and American literature and film has created a multitude of identities and sexualities in these societies. Topics will include sexuality and Christianity, modernity, patriarchy, masculinity, etc."
