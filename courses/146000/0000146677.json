		"Are religion and science in conflict? They have experienced significant tensions yet they owe much to each other. This course introduces students to science and religion in the modern era and how they map out distinct territories. Students examine the mutual influence of science and religion in forming conceptions about what nature, fact, and belief are, and how these notions have changed. Students investigate topics such as the denial of science, human origins, and emergence."
