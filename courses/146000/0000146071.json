		"In the 1940s a new and dark form of filmmaking emerged in the United States that challenged the formulaic, romance-driven plots that comprised much of Hollywood cinema during and after WWII. Labeled film noir by the French critics who viewed and admired them across the Atlantic, these American films focused on crime, morally ambiguous characters, and a society in despair. In addition to noir classics like The Big Sleep, Double Indemnity, Laura, and The Naked City, students will also watch neo-noir films like Devil in a Blue Dress and Mulholland Drive along with examples of European and Asian noir films. Furthermore, students read supplemental texts that help shed light on the historical evolution of the genre and the aesthetic and social relevance of its heterogeneous forms. May be repeated if topic is different."
