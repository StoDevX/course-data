		"This course investigates literary portrayals of mental health and investigates the ethics of portraying mental illness in a literary text. We will be attentive to how mental health and mental illness have been understood and defined differently in different historical periods, as well as how discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and immigrant status impacts mental health and mental health treatment. Students will also complete the Writing in the Major requirement for Norwegian."
