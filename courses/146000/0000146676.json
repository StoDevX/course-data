		"Epidemiology is the science of applying information about populations with the goal of improving health. This course will focus on multiple epidemiological research strategies in scientific, social and ethical context. By examining the range of health problems and diseases affecting diverse cultures, races, and ethnic groups, students gain understanding of epidemiology as the science of public health. Offered periodically to all St Olaf students in the fall semester. Does not count toward the nursing major. Counts toward public health studies concentration. Prerequisites: NURS 150 and one of BIO 121, BIO 123, BIO 143, BIO 150, or CH/BI 227, and any statistics course."
