		"More than half of the planet's population lives under non-democratic rule, and 40% of the world's governments are authoritarian. This course examines the domestic and international challenges authoritarian leaders face in their quest to stay in power. Focusing on contemporary examples of political dynamics in authoritarian regimes, students consider survival strategies related to ideology, coercion, cooptation, electoral manipulation, patronage distribution, economic growth, and civil-military relations. Offered annually. Prerequisite: prior course work in Political Science recommended."
