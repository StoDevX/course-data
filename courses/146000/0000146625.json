		"This course explores three different moments of revolutionary upheaval in the Middle East: Syria and Iraq in the 1950s and â€˜60s, Iran in the 1970s and 1980s, and Egypt during and after the Arab Spring, in the period between 2010-2015. How did revolutionary groups together with a mixture of internal and external pressures produce changes that affected politics and different dimensions of society and culture? How did these revolutionary upheavals set in motion counter-revolutions and unintended consequences? Students will work with primary and secondary literature, newspapers, documentaries, film, and literature, and will have the opportunity to develop specific topics of research depending on their own academic background and interests."
