		"How do relationships change as adolescents move into young adulthood and beyond? The time when families launch young adults and young adults develop their sense of individual identities is an exciting stage of family life, full of change and opportunity, tension and confusion. Students will reflect on their own experience and explore relationships in young adulthood with parent and grandparent figures, siblings, and romantic partners through scholarly articles, novels, media and music. Developmental processes and trends in relationships in a variety of cultural contexts, as well as reflection on narrative examples, will be included. Students will write several short essays as well as work together on a group project to demonstrate their learning."
