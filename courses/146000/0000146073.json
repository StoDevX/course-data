	"description": [
		"\"What kind of creature is a human being?\" explores an impossibly big question at the heart of higher education. To do so we will read a series of odd books, one by a sociologist on the \"global party circuit,\" another on walking and human evolution, and a third by an artist entitled \"How to Do Nothing\" that contemplates modern maladies like TikTok. As we examine humanity in this broad sweep, we will also consider college as a rite of passage and a social institution. How does St. Olaf shape you as a kind of person? Prerequisite: curiosity."
