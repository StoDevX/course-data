		"This course invites students into a relationship with song literature by African American composers. Students will examine this genre through the lens of social movements that shaped and impacted musical development despite under-representation in the canon. Additionally, students will focus on Black identity and aesthetics while analyzing poetry and researching historical and living composer narratives. This course's primary goal is to prepare students to advocate and perform these works for 21st-century audiences. Offered alternate years in the spring. Also counts toward the race and ethnic studies concentration."
