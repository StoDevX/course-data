		"This course is an introduction to dynamical systems (nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations) with applications to biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. The course will sequence with Math 230 and carry the attributes C/M. Emphasis will be placed on communication and visualization of dynamical systems behavior. The class will be similar in substantial ways to PHYS 374: Classical Mechanics, a required physics class for majors, so enrollment should be limited to those who have not taken and/or do not intend to take that course."
