		"The course introduces students to the historical, social, cultural, and political aspects of selected traditional African dance forms ranging from West, East North, South and Central Africa. The course equipped students with the knowledge and skills to explore dance as cultural practice from the perspectives of those involved as dancers, dance makers, teachers, and researchers. In this course the relationship between the dances and the accompanying music will be explored from an Afrocentric lens. By studying these perspectives, students learnt how different people in Africa and diaspora around the world understand dance and how dance influences their value systems, transmission, and socio-politico-cultural knowledge production. It also deals with the origin, context of performance, as well as the costumes, props and make-up and other information on the dances."
