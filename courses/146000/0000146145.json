		"This course provides a historical overview of documentary cinema. At the same time, the class examines the major theoretical questions and concerns that frame and distinguish between different types of documentary filmmaking. We address the documentary's particular investment in public, social and political issues, alongside the ethical questions that this mode of production raises. The course will engage with a variety of films from different countries and periods, but the last few weeks will be devoted to a specific movement or style of documentary. Films may include Nanook of the North, The Spanish Earth, Blood of the Beasts, Night and Fog, Sans Soleil, Titicut Follies, The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes, Gimme Shelter, The Thin Blue Line, Fahrenheit 9/11, and Flee. May be repeated if topic is different, and can also count towards 200 electives for FMS majors that have already completed a different version of FMS 350. Prerequisite: FMS 101."
