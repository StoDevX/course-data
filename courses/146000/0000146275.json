		"In this seminar, students engage in a contemplative discussion of the works of the \"father of existentialism,\" Søren Kierkegaard. His thoughts about the challenge of living a meaningful life take us through unusual territory. We examine the significance of anxiety and despair, beauty and boredom, humor and seriousness, the joy and pain of embodiment, the tension between religious faith and secular reason, and, finally, the importance of commitment and love."
