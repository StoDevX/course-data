		"This course explores the nature and dynamics of connections that exist between economic agents like firms, banks, countries, and individuals. How do loans between banks cause recessions? How do high schools look to their peers for policy ideas? How does misinformation spread on social media? Students will use economic theory as well as economic data to answer these questions and more. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisites: ECON 260, ECON 261, and ECON 262."
