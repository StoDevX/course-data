		"This course explores environmental themes in Russian literature and culture from the nineteenth century to the present day. Beginning with the early ecological concerns in classic Russian literature (Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Chekhov), we move on to works by major Soviet writers and filmmakers (Tarkovsky, Aitmatov, Bitov) and conclude with the post-Soviet environmental movement in Russia. This course is both a study in environmentalism and a broad introduction to Russian culture. Taught in English; all readings in English; no prerequisites."
