		"Students explore questions of identity in the wider Francophone world through reading, discussing and analyzing a wide variety of texts, including cultural documents, short biographical pieces, literary texts, and films. They consolidate their language skills and continue to develop their ability to analyze and communicate in French by engaging in interactive group activities, making oral presentations and writing essays. They also work to expand their vocabulary and to review the French verb system and other key grammatical structures. Prerequisite: French 231 or placement. Offered each semester."
