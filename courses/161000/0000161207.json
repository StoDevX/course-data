		"Although fairy tales are often stereotyped as the province of Disney animators today, this perception does not reflect the range of film adaptations that have been made over the years, nor does it reflect the tone or intentions of the original fairy tales. This seminar will introduce students to fairy tales from a variety of cultural traditions and to some of their many American film adaptations. Engaging with both written and film sources, as well as selected literary criticism and film reviews, students will explore the cultural anxieties and values that shaped early written fairy tales, and the changing cultures and media forms that prompted the revisions to these tales that we see in modern film. After developing skills in literary and film analysis and assessing a variety of commentaries on the adaptation process, students will work in teams to produce a proposal for an original film adaptation of their chosen fairy tale."
