		"Why do we love some animals to the point of considering them family members, but vilify and even eat others? What legal rights, if any, should non-human animals have? Other-than-human animals are an overwhelming presence in our collective and individual lives, yet they are often taken for granted by us human animals. We share our social and cultural environments with a wide variety of animals and for a wide variety of purposes. We domesticate animals and use them for food, clothing, entertainment, and transportation. We hunt them for subsistence and sport. We worship, sacrifice, display, vilify, cherish, and study them. In this seminar, students explore questions regarding the intersection of the lives of human and non-human animals in a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary manner. Students consider a variety of perspectives and develop their own logical and evidence-based arguments regarding these matters."
