		"St. Olaf's campus shapes our experience here in many ways. Chairs invite us to pause and take in the natural beauty while the buildings' architecture suggests tradition and a respect for formal education. Even the way a classroom is set up can suggest what is expected from us in that room. This seminar invites students to critically read and analyze the spaces around them. We will map them, measure them, and uncover their stories. Then we will look at how these spaces might be improved in order to better fit the needs of today's (and tomorrow's) Oles. Fall 2024 will place a special emphasis on residence halls and may include an opportunity for students to participate in events related to St. Olaf's 150th anniversary."
