		"In this seminar course, students explore new advances and applications at the intersection of evolution and genetics. Short lectures and in-class activities provide students with the necessary background to analyze primary scientific articles, and small group discussions provide a forum for student-led discourse and critique of these articles. Each student undertakes a literature research project on a topic of their choice; this semester-long project includes regular faculty consultation and peer review. Also counts toward biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 233 or permission of the instructor."
