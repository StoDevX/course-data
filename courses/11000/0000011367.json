		"Through lectures, readings and field placements in Minneapolis, students gain an understanding of how race, class, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and religion shape the character of urban youth and communities. Students spend the first week on campus in preparation for their placements and the last week reflecting upon their experiences. During weeks two and three students live in Minneapolis and tutor in the schools and participate in various after-school activities. Counts toward the major: American Racial and Multicultural Studies."
