		"Students perform experiments that illustrate the principles of physical chemistry and utilize modern instrumentation. Students synthesize and analyze copolymers, perform spectroscopic measurements of molecular energy levels and perform calculations of quantum mechanical quantities using computer workstations. Students also develop their scientific writing skills by preparing reports in the style of scientific publications. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in Chemistry 371. P/N only. Offered both semesters."
