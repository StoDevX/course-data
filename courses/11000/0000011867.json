		"In this reflective capstone course, teacher candidates study, experience and reflect upon the influences that technology, cultural diversity, personal health and chemical abuse have upon schooling, home life, community stability and, ultimately, their own students' achievement. Students build upon student teaching to determine the essential knowledge and skills of educators as change agents and their future roles as first-year teachers. This workshop follows student teaching. Student teachers only. Special section offered for St. Thomas Elementary students."
