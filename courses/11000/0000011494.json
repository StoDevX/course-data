		"This course introduces philosophical ideas and methods through reading, discussing and writing about basic questions that arise when we reflect on the human condition. What is meant by meaning when one asks whether (a person's) life has meaning? How do our beliefs about human nature, religion and morality affect how we ask or answer the question? How does our mortality affect our living? Classical and contemporary writings -- philosophical and autobiographical -- will be used. Offered only in Interim."
