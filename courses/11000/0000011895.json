The focus will be on the theatrical dance genres of: ballet, modern and musical theater dance. Social dance will also be looked at as the predecessor of some theatrical dance genres. At the same time, the course attends to the economic, religious and social forces which have affected the development of dance in America. Extensive video examples supplement reading, writing and discussion. Attendance at appropriate concerts is required.",
