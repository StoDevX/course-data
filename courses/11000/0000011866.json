		"All candidates must have a multicultural field experience to help develop their competence in teaching in multicultural environments. A minimum of 40 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment is required prior to student teaching for the Class of 2005 and beyond; a full four-week Interim or its equivalent is required. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: Education 378 (Multicultural Education in Hawaii); Education 379 (Urban Education Seminar and Practicum); ID 259 (FLES-Foreign Languages in the Elementary Schools); or ID 260 (Dimensions of Multiculture and Awareness); internships in multicultural schools. (See Education Department faculty and web site for advice and information.) Education 382 is not a course. Rather it is a recording mechanism indicating St. Olaf students who have completed their multicultural education requirement. Students register for Education 382 during their professional semester."
