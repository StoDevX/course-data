		"In this century of institutional development, national expansion and sectional conflict, Americans continued to define a national identity. Students probe the ways in which region, religion, race, ethnicity and gender inform individual and group contributions to the conversation. They also analyze how geographical expansion and ideas of progress influenced different visions and versions of America. Topics and texts include Transcendentalist writers, the Second Great Awakening, Black Elk Speaks, landscape painting and Western photography."
