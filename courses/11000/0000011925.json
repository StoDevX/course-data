Through attention to life experiences, cultural contexts and the impact of history, the course offers students a rounded and complex understanding of a major author's literary achievement. Recent authors have included Chaucer, Milton, George Eliot, Joyce and Woolf. Because such study is intensive and requires background, students should have prior exposure to the author studied. Authors announced the previous spring. May be repeated if topics are different",
