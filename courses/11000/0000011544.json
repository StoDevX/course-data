		"Students explore geographic, economic, political and ethnic dimensions of life in present-day Ecuador by combining intensive course work with such cross-cultural experiences as a homestay in Quito, interactions with university students in Quito, field trips to an indigenous maket in Otavalo, the Amazon region east of Tena, and so forth. They consolidate their language skills and continue to develop their skills for analyzing and communicating in Spanish by writing compositions, making oral presentations, interviewing their host families, visiting indigenous homes and engaging in other interactive group activities. Prerequisite: Spanish 231 or placement."
