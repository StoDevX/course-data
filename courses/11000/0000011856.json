		"This course prepares pre-service communication arts/literature teachers to share their love of the English language with secondary students. Attention is given to the theory and techniques of teaching speech, listening, media literacy, writing, literature and reading. In addition, students read adolescent novels, teach lessons in local schools, correct papers written by high school students and create a portfolio for a job interview. It should be noted that this new course title reflects a change in the Minnesota State certification guidelines for what used to be called the Teaching of English/Language Arts. Offered Spring Semester only."
