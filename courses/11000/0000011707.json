		"This course highlights major visual arts movements within China over the last century, from the end of the imperial era to current times. We look at a variety of issues: class and gender; China in the world art market; Chinese art past and present; and a variety of \"isms\" now seen as defining Chinese art. A major theme is to define visual culture in all its nuances."
