Laboratories include identification, morphology and specimen preparation. During field trips, students document bird migrations, amphibian chorusing and other animal activities. Independent projects explore topics ranging from bluebird nesting behavior to thermal conductivity and insulation in animals. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Taught annually. Prerequisites: Biology 125, 126.",
