		"Students analyze literary works of different genres as aesthetic treatments of philosophical themes. Poetry, prose and drama explore themes such as the metaphysics and ethics of freedom, the problem of evil and the role of character in choice and action. For example, with Camus students explore such ideas as absurdity, lucidity, rebellion and human solidarity by studying plot, character, point of view, imagery and symbolism."
