		"This course pursues the expansion of Christianity throughout the Roman world and the synthesis of the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman in the early Middle Ages. Students consider the development of a unified world view as expressed in religious devotions, philosophy, literature, and art and in monasticism and feudalism in Church and Empire. Students discuss works by Augustine, Benedict, Hildegard of Bingen, Aquinas, Dante, Chaucer and Christine de Pisan, medieval drama and the artistry of Chartres Cathedral."
