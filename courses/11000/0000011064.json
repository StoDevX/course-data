	"description": "This course introduces students to anthropological theory and the culture of the discipline itself. We will examine anthropology's formation during the Industrial Revolution and the Age of Empire, which called for new explanations of human differences and gave new significance to the nature and meaning of culture. We will explore the method of participant observation research, the question of whether anthropology is a science, the problem of representing one culture to another and the changing nature of ethnographic writing.",
