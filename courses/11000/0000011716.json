	"description": "Students study the biology of organisms emphasizing the relationship of structure and function within an ecological/evolutionary context. Common requirements of all organisms are contrasted with the diversity of solutions displayed by the myriad of species alive today. Labs investigate form, physiology and behavior of selected organisms. Students attend lectures plus one 2.5-hour laboratory per week. Taught annually. GE: NST-B, NSL. Prerequisite: Biology 125.",
