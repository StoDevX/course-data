		"This course provides students with a transition from calculus and linear algebra to more advanced courses in theoretical mathematics. The unique feature of the off-campus course is that it is taught with a cultural context in Budapest, Hungary. This course not only supplies a bridge from beginning to advanced mathematics, but also allows the participants to encounter one of the important world-wide centers of mathematics. Prerequisite: Mathematics 220. Offered Interim only."
