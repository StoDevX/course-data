		"From the intimate personal essay to more externally driven literary journalism, creative nonfiction covers a range of forms. Students learn to combine fictional techniques, personal recollections and direct exposition in assignments that might include memoir, personal essay, cultural criticism, nature writing, book and film reviewing and new journalism. Contemporary nonfiction writers such as Annie Dillard, Scott Russell Sanders, Judith Ortiz Cofer and John McPhee provide models and inspiration for writing in the course."
