		"This course surveys the diverse arts produced by people of African descent in the Americas (U.S. and the Caribbean), from the colonial period to the present. An examination of selected West and Central African cultural practices and art forms serves as a basis for understanding creative transformations in the African Diaspora. Important issues to be addressed include art and resistance, survivals and transformations, and ideas about race and the construction of beauty."
