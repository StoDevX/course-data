Through readings, site visits, interactions with peers in the target languages, homestays and journal writing in both English and their target language, students learn about how Asians in these two countries perceive themselves and their role in the region and in the world, both in the past and in the present. They travel to Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Nagasaki and Tokyo. Prerequisite: Asian Studies 211 or permission of the instructor.",
