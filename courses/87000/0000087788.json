		"Russian literature has always been more than literature, serving as the major catalyst for cultural and social change in the country. This was especially true and important in the Soviet Union, where censors controlled literary production at every level, in terms of form and content. The readings for this course span the entire Soviet era, including such authors as Zamyatin, Ilf and Petrov, Olesha, Platonov, Kharms, Bulgakov, Solzhenitsyn, and Petrushevskaya. In English translation."
