		"What is the mind-body connection? We explore the major issues, theories, and interventions in health psychology. Students review evidence for the impact of psychological and behavioral factors on the immune system and health. Psychosocial approaches to the major diseases, their rationale, and the evidence supporting these interventions are examined. Introductory biology and psychopathology strongly recommended. Prerequisite: Psychology 231, 264, and 238 or Biology 123 or 125. Offered most years."
