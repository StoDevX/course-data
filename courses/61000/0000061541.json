	"desc": "This course introduces chemical concepts that are important for students pursuing a study of chemistry or biology. Topics include atomic structure, the Periodic Table, bonding interactions within and between particles, water and its solutions, biological membranes, chemical reaction types, chemical stoichiometry, equilibrium systems, acids and bases, introduction to protein structure. Examples are often pulled from the realm of biological molecules and processes. Students attend three classes and one 3-hour laboratory each week. Prerequisites: high school biology, chemistry and physics. Students should consider concurrent registration in Mathematics 120 or 121. Placement via online placement exam is required. Offered Fall Semester.",
