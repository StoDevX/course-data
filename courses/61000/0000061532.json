		"This seminar explores current research and theory, practices, and policies regarding child development from birth to age three. Students learn about prenatal development, birth and the newborn, physical development, the infant-caregiver relationship, infant cognition, and language development. Students also consider evidence about childcare, early intervention, and the influence of media and interactive toys designed for very young children. Cross-cultural comparisons highlight issues of diversity. Prerequisite: Psychology 231, and 241. Offered most years."
