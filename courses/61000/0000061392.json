		"Students encounter the theory of calculus and develop tools for communicating mathematical ideas with technical accuracy and sophistication. The goal is mastery of the concepts (e.g., limit, continuity, derivatives, and integrals) necessary to verify such important results as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the continuity of the uniform limit of continuous functions, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. Prerequisite: Mathematics 126 or 128. Offered both semesters."
