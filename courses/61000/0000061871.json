		"Students examine the Renaissance's return to classical values and the Reformation's return to early Christian attitudes which challenge the authority of the medieval synthesis. Students trace the development of new sources of authority including the new science with its influence on art, literature, politics, and philosophy. Discussions consider writers and artists such as Luther, Calvin, Descartes, Locke, Milton, Aphra Behn, Voltaire, Rousseau, Goethe, Teresa of Avila, Michaelangelo, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Bach, and Shakespeare. Prerequisites: Great Conversation 113, 115, and 116."
