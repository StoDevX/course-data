	"description": "Students examine the work of a major British author. Through attention to life experiences, cultural contexts, and the impact of history, the course offers students a rounded and complex understanding of a major author's literary achievement. Recent authors have included Milton, Dickens, George Eliot, Joyce, and Woolf. Because such study is intensive and requires background, students should have prior exposure to the author studied. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: English 185 plus one additional course of relevant background.",
