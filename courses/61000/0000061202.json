		"This course surveys the origins and development of Western philosophy starting with the pre- Socratics. Students explore the historical foundations of natural science, metaphysics, and ethics in the works of the pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics, usually through primary texts. The course concludes with a brief examination of some medieval attempts to synthesize the Greek philosophical tradition and the Judeo-Christian religious heritage. Prerequisite: one course in Philosophy or consent of instructor. Offered every year."
