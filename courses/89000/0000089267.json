		"Env Studies 381 Ecosystems Research (Natural Science) - John Schade",
		"Students in this course will learn the process of identifying and developing a research proposal focused on a significant question in ecosystem science. We will discuss how to generate good research questions and hypotheses, find and synthesize important literature sources from the library, and develop a research plan. The final produce of student activities will be a research proposal. Students will also lead and participate in discussions of current literature in ecosystem science. The content of the course will be determined in part by student interest, within the constraint that topics must address an important concept in the study of ecosystems."
