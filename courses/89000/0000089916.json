	"description": "This course extends and generalizes methods introduced in Statistics 272 by introducing generalized linear models (GLMs) and correlated data methods. GLMs cover logistic and Poisson regression, and more. Correlated data methods include longitudinal data analysis and multilevel models. Applications are drawn from across the disciplines. Prerequisite: Statistics 272. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward neuroscience concentration.",
