		"Students perform experiments that illustrate the principles of physical chemistry and utilize modern instrumentation. Students characterize the thermodynamic properties of a biopolymer, perform spectroscopic measurements of molecular energy levels, calculate quantum mechanical quantities using computer workstations, and investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of chemical reactions. Students also develop their scientific writing skills by preparing reports in the style of scientific publications. P/N only. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in Chemistry 371. Offered each semester."
