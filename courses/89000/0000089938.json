	"description": "Students not only investigate the theory of modern analytical chemistry, but also examine the statistical treatment of errors, equilibrium, activities, acid/base chemistry, spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and separations. The accompanying lab course, Chemistry 256, illustrates the topics discussed in Chemistry 255. Students taking this course use computers for solving problems. Prerequisite: Chemistry 126 or Chemistry/Biology 227 or permission of the instructor. Concurrent registration in Chemistry 256 is required. Offered each semester. Counts toward environmental studies major (all tracks) and concentration.",
