		"Health begins where we live, work and play. Students are immersed in public, private, and community-based organizations in Northfield (rural) and Minneapolis-St. Paul (urban) to gain an understanding of the social determinants of health (environmental conditions, resources and supports) and the relationship to individual health outcomes through service learning. A special emphasis is placed on the impact of socioeconomic status, geographic location, and disability on health disparities. Offered occasionally during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Prerequisite: one course in sociology/anthropology, women's and gender studies, social work, family studies, economics, political science, environmental studies, or nursing."
