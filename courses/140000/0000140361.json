		"This course focuses on the development of the U.S. economy since colonial times and the contributions and limitations of economic analysis and quantitative methods in understanding the economy's evolution. The course explores how economic analysis illuminates past trends and events, and how the historical record can further our understanding of economic principles, theory, and current economic problems. Course topics include colonialism, slavery, industrialization, the economic effects of wars, and the Great Depression. Prerequisites: ECON 261 and/or ECON 262 (at the discretion of the instructor) and one of ECON 260 or ECON 263 or STAT 272, or permission of the instructor."
