		"This course examines the representation of nature from creation narratives of Norse myth, 19th century nation-building, and up to present concerns about climate change and environmental destruction in the Nordic region. Students examine central works and contested notions of nature. Alongside these, they will be introduced to ecocriticism as a method of textual analysis. This method provides an entryway into the environmental humanities, and an opportunity to explore what makes Nordic literature and culture unique. Offered periodically. Also counts toward environmental studies major, and environmental studies and Nordic studies concentrations."
