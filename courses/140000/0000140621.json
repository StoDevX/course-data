		"This course engages students in academic and public discourse (audience, purpose, genre, context) related to a particular topic. Students write in multiple genres and engage in writing as a systematic, interactive process. They understand, evaluate, and use appropriate technologies for different purposes and audiences. Writing and Rhetoric is part of the FirstYear Experience, which includes two distinct activities to support college transition: students participate in structured and sustained orientation to support their academic and cocurricular development, and students reflect on this development."
