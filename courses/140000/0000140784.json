		"This course traces the political, economic, social, sexual, and familial experiences of two generations of women and girls in Germany from 1914 to 1948. We will focus on how gender, nation, and race operated as intersectional identities during each of four governments. Half of the course will be focused on the construction and radicalization of Nazi policies to create the \"master race\" while destroying the \"undesirables\" such as Jews, Roma and Sinti, and people with disabilities during its colonization of Europe. This course comes with a serious trigger warning: We will discuss difficult topics such as forced and invasive medical practices, extreme sexual violence, and female perpetration in the Holocaust."
