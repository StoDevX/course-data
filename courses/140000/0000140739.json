		"How does a musician find work with little or no prior professional experience? What skills do musicians need to refine before and after graduation? This course invites students to engage in self-reflection, topical discussions, capacity-building, and best professional practices for individual musicians in the performance industry. Topics include the basics of the music business (agents and roles in the industry, copyright law and contracts), artist identity development, and practical skills for a musical career (creating a digital portfolio, professional networking, building a private studio). Offered alternate years in the fall semester."
