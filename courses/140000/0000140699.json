		"Students in this course develop critical, historically informed, cross-cultural perspectives on race in the United States by investigating the roots of racial thought in the world of the Greeks and Romans over two millennia ago. Topics include comparative racial formation; ancient theories of race and their impacts on the modern world; racist structures across time and space; and the contingency of cultural responses to ethnic difference and “otherness.” Readings range from antiquity to 21st-century America. Offered periodically in fall and spring semesters. Also counts toward ancient studies, classics, Greek, and Latin majors."
