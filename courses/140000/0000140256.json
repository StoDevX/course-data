		"This course is an introduction to film analysis. Students learn the language used to describe and understand various features and aspects of the cinema. In addition to exploring the elements that make up a film, students also think carefully about the decisions, techniques, and strategies that inform film production. Topics of study include narrative, mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, film sound, and, later in the course, broader categories of classification such as genre and mode."
