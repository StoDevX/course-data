		"Southeast Asia is a diverse region, including Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians, high-tech cities and swidden agriculture, and a varied history intertwined with Europe, North America, East Asia, and India. Students read ethnographies, novels, and local histories to better understand key political changes that have shaped Southeast Asian family life, religion, language, and education. Through focusing on the experience of modernity, students examine how Southeast Asians make sense of their group affiliations, their pasts, and their futures. Offered annually. Also counts toward Asian studies major and concentration."
