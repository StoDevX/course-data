		"Students explore diverse experiences of modern Latin America through the lenses of gender and race, which provide a productive framework for examining economic, class, and other key aspects of Latin American society. Students will work with a variety of sources, both literary and non-literary, including articles, images, documents, and at least one substantive literary work. This cultural analysis provides for the development of critical reading and writing skills (e.g., description, narration, exposition, and argumentation). Taught in Spanish. Offered each semester. Also counts toward Latin American studies, race and ethnic studies, and women’s and gender studies majors and international relations, race and ethnic studies, and women’s and gender studies concentrations. Prerequisite: SPAN 232 or SPAN 233 or SPAN 234 or placement."
