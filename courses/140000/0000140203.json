		"This seminar integrates the experience of work and the search for career in the context of Norway. Course content includes both an internship in Oslo and a reflection seminar. The reflection seminar connects academic theories/analyses of work and Norwegian culture with the internship experience. Through reading, writing, and discussion, this course provides a space in which to reflect on the challenges, hopes, and fears facing students embarking on their postgraduation careers. Also counts toward Norwegian, history, environmental studies, political science, and exercise science majors; and educational studies, Nordic studies, and statistics and data science concentrations. Offered alternate years during Interim. Prerequisite: completion of FOL in Norwegian."
