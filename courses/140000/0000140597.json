		"How did the Bible become “the Bible”? Introduces students to the dynamic social, literary, and intellectual development of scriptural traditions that emerge as the Hebrew Bible and its further development into ancient Jewish literature, Christian Scriptures, and Rabbinic Judaism. The course emphasizes Scripture as a vital, unfolding notion in human culture, with particular attention to the Ancient Israelite and Jewish communities that produced them. Students will encounter academic practices in the study of religious texts."
