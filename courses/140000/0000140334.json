This class helps students develop skills in assessing, selecting, and creating high-quality music literature appropriate for instructing instrumental ensembles in elementary and secondary schools. A comprehensive review of recommended published repertoire culminates in programming projects. Additionally, students acquire the technical craft and artistic sensibilities needed to create successful arrangements for instrumental ensembles. Counts toward BA music major and all BM majors. Required for BM music instrumental education majors. Offered alternate years in the fall semester. Prerequisite: MUSIC 114."
