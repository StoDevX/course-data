		"This course is a continuation of CHEM 247 topics. Chemistry 248 delves into the chemistry of functional groups, especially those that play a role in the reactivity of biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins ,and nucleic acids. Together, CHEM 247 and CHEM 248 provide a full treatment of introductory organic chemistry. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward environmental studies major (natural science emphasis) and biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisite: CHEM 247 or permission of instructor."
