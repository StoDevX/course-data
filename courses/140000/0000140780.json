		"In this course students use topics in discrete mathematics to engage in problem solving, abstract mathematical thinking, and logical reasoning. Students practice proof writing in multiple contexts, including: propositional and predicate logic; the foundations of set theory, functions, and relations; elementary number theory; arithmetic and geometric progressions; permutations, combinations, and basic probability; and graph theory. Offered annually in the spring. Also counts toward computer science major and management studies concentration. Prerequisites: Either CSCI 221 or one of MATH 126 or MATH 128."
