		"This course is a broad introduction to the history of East Asia as a region from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1990s. Through three spatial modules -- the Sinophone (Chinese-speaking) World, the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Archipelago -- students explore the interconnections and divisions between emergent nation-states and empires at a time of rapid social, cultural, and political change. Offered annually. Also counts toward Chinese and Japanese majors."
