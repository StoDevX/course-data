		"What do workers want from work? What do employers want from workers? Pressing policy issues exist for workers competing in the global economy. Unions, unemployment insurance, welfare and the minimum wage enhance the prospects of many, while leaving others even worse off. This course utilizes microeconomic theory, statistics and institutional analysis to understand labor markets. Offered annually. Prerequisites: ECON 262 and one of ECON 260 or ECON 263 or STAT 272, completion of BTS-T, or permission of instructor."
