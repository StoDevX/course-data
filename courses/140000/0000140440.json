		"Why do states create and join international organizations (IOs)? What roles do they play in solving global problems? The goal of this course is to help students develop a theoretical as well as a practical understanding of international organizations and the global problems they attempt to address. Particular emphasis will be placed on students' ability to think critically, both about global challenges and the global governance mechanisms designed to solve these challenges."
