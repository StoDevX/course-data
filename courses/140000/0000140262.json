		"For much of film history the film director has been considered to be an author not unlike a writer of a novel or composer of a symphony. In this course students closely analyze the authorship of influential film directors, while also critically evaluating the role of the director along with the many other artists and workers that contribute to the meaning and production of film. May be repeated if topics are different. Offered alternate years in the spring semester beginning spring semester 2021-22."
