		"Students study the mathematics of Emmy Noether and Sonya Kovalevskaya, visit cultural and historical sites in Germany and Sweden associated with the women, and learn about the societal contexts in which they lived and worked. Noether was fundamental in the development of algebra, in particular the theory of how rings decompose into ideals. Kovalevskaya extended work of Cauchy to prove the main theorem for analytic solutions to partial differential equations. Offered alternate years during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Prerequisites: MATH 252, or MATH 230 and MATH 244."
