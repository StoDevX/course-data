		"A basic introduction to astronomy, this course concentrates on How do we know what we know? Students explore questions such as How do we measure the distance to a star? and How do we know the universe is expanding? In addition to studying the solar system, stars, black holes, galaxies and the history of the universe, students engage in rooftop viewing using the department's telescopes. Prerequisite: proficiency in algebra and geometry. Currently offered both semesters."
