		"Contemplating art in relation to aesthetic as well as religious and moral values, students address such issues as the nature of creation and creativity, the character of visual metaphor and the meaning of selected historical and contemporary works of art. While developing a more informed appreciation of aesthetic properties of art, students analyze major texts in philosophy of art and art criticism."
