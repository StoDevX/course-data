		"More and more, world politics, the politics among nations, controls domestic politics. With the fall of Communism an entirely new world regime is emerging. By examining the subjects of realism, globalism, power, levels of analysis, ideology, global inequality, non-state actors, political economy, transnational policy issues, war, peace and international organization, students are challenged to come to grips with these changes. Offered periodically."
