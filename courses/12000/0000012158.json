	"desc": "Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields, with activity ranging from the fundamentals of behavior to molecular aspects of neuronal function. This course will provide a foundation and overview of the important and extensive ways in which biological and physiological processes are involved in the regulation and maintenance of behavior. Among the topics we explore are: fundamental electrophysiology, sensory and motor systems, integration, learning and memory and the mind-body connection.
