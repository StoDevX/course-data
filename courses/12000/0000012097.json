		"This course focuses on four basic financial statements: the income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. Students learn how business events are recorded and represented on the financial statements and how to use the information to make sound economic judgments. Cases and current articles supplement traditional textbook readings and problems. This is a core course in the management studies concentration, offered each semester."
