		"Students examine feminist approaches to and critiques of aspects of contemporary culture that shape women's lives. These may include conventional morality, science, education, art, medicine, law, religion and social institutions such as marriage and political institutions. Students critically examine historical or contemporary philosophical views that underlie as well as those that challenge these institutions, including views of human nature, gender, rationality, knowledge, morality, justice and the value of autonomy."
