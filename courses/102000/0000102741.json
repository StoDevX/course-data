		"This course serves as an introductory survey of the diverse arts and cultures of sub-Saharan Africa. Students investigate material culture in its original context to understand the social roles that art plays in many aspects of life. Students also learn to identify and discuss styles, materials, techniques, and the roles of artists. Special topics considered may include: contemporary versus historical art in Africa, notions of \"authenticity\" and tourist art, cultural heritage and repatriation of art works, and the politics and history of museum display. Offered periodically. Counts toward Africa and the Americas concentration."
