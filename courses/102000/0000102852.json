	"desc": "Food Writing: Adventures in Gastronomy - French writer Brillat-Savarin declares in The Physiology of Taste of 1848, \u0093Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.\u0094 American writer Mark Kurlansky insists in his 2002 Choice Cuts: A Savory Selection of Food Writing from around the World and throughout History, \u0093Food is about agriculture, about ecology, about man\u0092s relationship with nature, about the climate, about nation-building, cultural struggles, friends and enemies, alliances, wars, religion. It is about memory and tradition and, at times, even about sex.\u0094 Cooking, eating, and the representation of food as a topic of academic inquiry as well as one of enormous import in popular culture are the focus of this writing seminar. Through a number of formal and informal writing assignments students will explore the role of food in a variety of contexts such as literature, art, history, film, journalism and television. Texts and films may include Michael Pollan\u0092s recent work of nonfiction Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, Emile Zola\u0092s nineteenth-century novel, The Belly of Paris, articles and essays by Roland Barthes, Wendell Berry, Michelle Obama, Margaret Mead, Barbarba Kingsolver, and Anthony Bourdain, as well as Gabriel Axel\u0092s 1987 Danish movie, Babette\u0092s Feast.",
