		"In this course students gain an appreciation for the drug development process, including how natural products are isolated, how their structures relate to activities, and how research into the mechanism of disease leads to the targeted development of drugs. Issues relating to medicinal chemistry in a developing-world context, medicinal plants, and the chemical basis of folk medicine are discussed. Offered alternate years during Interim. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration (for students through class of 2016). Prerequisites: CHEM 248 and CHEM 254."
