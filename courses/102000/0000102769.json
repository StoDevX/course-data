	"description": "Students examine the transformation of Germany from a system of cottage industries to factory production in urban environments. With the industrial revolution came migration to the cities, new transportation systems, and overpopulation. While the concentration of people in these urban centers brought about the development of arts, music, theater, schools, universities, and other cultural institutions, it also created social challenges for health, labor, welfare, and education. Counts toward the German major or German studies concentration. Offered annually.",
