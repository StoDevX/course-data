	"desc": "This course focuses on the use of statistics in a social science context. Students investigate three essential questions: How can one reliably measure something? How does one design valid research? How does one analyze research results? Topics include ANOVA designs (for example, one-way and two-way with interaction), data reduction methods, and principles of measurement. Interdisciplinary groups work together on case studies throughout the term. Offered in alternate years. Prerequisites: STAT 110, STAT 212, or STAT 214, or ECON 263, or equivalent preparation, or permission of the instructor.",
