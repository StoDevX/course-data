		"This seminar explores American conservatism, especially since the 1930s. How did conservatism survive the New Deal? How did postwar conservatism and liberalism shape one another? What accounts for conservatism's dramatic rise in the last quarter of the 20th century? How have historians' approaches changed--from studies of grassroots activists, to political leaders, to intellectual and religious influences? Working closely with primary and secondary sources, students will practice the craft of history through seminar discussions and independent work."
