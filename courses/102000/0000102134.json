Each student's independent work with a faculty advisor culminates in a senior exhibition at Flaten Art Museum. Weekly sessions also cover such topics as preparing a resume, documenting one's work, framing, and producing exhibition announcements and posters. Offered annually. Prerequisites: (for non-studio majors) Art 102, ART 103, ART 104, two upper-level (200-300) courses, one art history course, and permission of chair"
