The genre studied may be broad, such as narrative fiction, or narrowly defined, such as the elegy. The course focuses on the study of literature through a critical exploration of form. May be repeated if topics are different. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term. Prerequisite: FYW.",
