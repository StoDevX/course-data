	"desc": "This course will focus on the close study of key operatic works from Monteverdi to the present day through the lens of contemporary theories of gender and identity construction. We will explore the operatic representation of masculinity and femininity and how they differ from their respective representations in other art forms. Another issue will be how ideas about gender can be codified within music, both with and without the aid of language. We will also discuss queer and gay identities within the history of opera.",
