Students examine a range of interpretations of Asia, including the spiritual, literary, philosophical and linguistic; and students present the ideas gathered from contacts made during interim at the beginning of the semester. Additional materials include memoirs, novels, films that share individualized interpretations of Asian journeys. Prerequisite: Chinese 231 or Japanese 231 and Asian Studies 215 or 216.
