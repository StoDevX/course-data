		"This course introduces students to key concepts and forms of proof found in theory courses (e.g., Mathematics 244 and Mathematics 252). Topics include basic logic and set theory, mathematical induction, primes, congruences, and infinite sets. Students learn to read, write, and understand mathematical proofs. Prerequisites: Mathematics 220 or permission of instructor. Offered during interim."
