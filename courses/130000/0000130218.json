		"This course explores legal systems vastly different from that in the United States and uses economic analysis to understand both the reasons for the peculiarities and their relative success or failure. The objective of this course is to deepen students' understanding of the basic economic principles used to analyze legal institutions and to teach them how to apply economic concepts to important, contemporary and historical topics. Offered annually. Prerequisites: ECON 262 and either ECON 263 or STAT 272, or permission of instructor."
