		"This course invites students to draw on narratives of Black families in the US. Students explore multidisciplinary theoretical constructs that address power, privilege, and identity in Black families. The concept of family is considered beyond biological kinship and across sexual orientation and class. Students engage multiple forms of narrative including, memoirs, fiction, poetry, art, and documentaries through a major assignment and small group exercises. Offered periodically during interim."
