		"This class examines the historical and contemporary aspects of sculptural installation art. The course structure provides for ample studio time, in-depth research, idea development, individual exploration, experimentation, play and critical feedback. Students learn about successful composition, productive conceptualization, and creative problem solving. Instruction and guidance will be provided for the media that students chose to work with in their projects. Possibilities include woodworking, sewing, metal, drawing, video, sound, and performance."
