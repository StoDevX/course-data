		"Immunology focuses on the structure, development, and function of the immune system. The course explores the molecular and cellular basis of the immune responses. The application of immunological principles to allergy, autoimmunity, AIDS, transplantation, and cancer are included. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Also counts toward biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisites: BIO 227 and BIO 233, or CH/BI 227 and BIO 233."
