		"Numerous Nordic film directors have been celebrated around the world for their important contributions to the art of cinema. In this course students both survey Nordic cinema through chosen examples of such celebrated directors, while also scrutinizing the idea of the film author itself. It asks students to consider what it is about these particular filmmakers that make them special and different from both mainstream and non-Nordic ones. Offered periodically."
