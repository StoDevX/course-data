		"The study of the anatomy and physiology of the human body is founded on a thorough understanding of the structure and function of cells and tissues. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour lab per week. Nursing and exercise science majors may pre-register for this course. This course may not be taken after completion of BIO 125, CH/BI 227, or BIO 227, any of which serve as a prerequisite for BIO 243: Human Anatomy and Physiology. Offered in the fall semester."
