	"desc": "How and why did the utopian dreams of nineteenth-century European intellectuals become the justification for twentieth-century totalitarian regimes? How did the goal of liberating workers from continual poverty and alienation lead to authoritarianism and mass terror on a scale never before witnessed? This seminar begins with the intellectual history of socialism, communism and other social theories in the nineteenth century meant to produce human progress. Having mapped this terrain, we will consider the rise of totalitarian regimes that appropriated these ideologies in the twentieth century. Topics will include utopian socialism, Marxism, Stalinism, National Socialism in Germany, fascism in Italy and gender and authoritarian regimes.",
