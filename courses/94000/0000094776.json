	"desc": "This seminar explores the rich scholarship on World War I that has developed as historians apply methodologies and insights from social and cultural history to the experience of war. The Great War that emerges from the distance of a new century is a complex and poignant phenomenon, revealing the truly global scope of the conflict, common and distinctively national challenges of modern war, the everday lives of soldiers and civilians (through the lenses of class and gender), and the ambiguities of the war's legacy (from \"industrial killing\" to ways of mourning).",
