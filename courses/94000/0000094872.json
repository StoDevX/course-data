Students also analyze and compose Western tonal music employing the rubrics of rhythm and meter, pitch, intervals, scales, tertian chords, inversions, harmonic progression, and SATB voice leading. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in MUSIC 161 (or placement into a higher level of keyboard proficiency). Offered annually in the fall semester."
