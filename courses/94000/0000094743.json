	"description": "Remote sensing and GIS are increasingly used to address basic and applied questions in the environmental sciences and a host of other disciplines. Students survey available remote sensing image types and learn to process (ground-truthing, GPS, scanning, digitizing) and interpret remotely sensed images. They also learn theory and practice of geographic information systems (basic cartography and spatial statistics). A weekly three-hour laboratory is required. Prerequisites: ENVST 137 or a level I course in biology, chemistry, or physics. Offered annually.",
