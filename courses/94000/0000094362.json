		"This course traces the path of invertebrate evolution from single-celled protozoans to the most primitive chordates. Emphasis is placed upon major breakthroughs in design that enable organisms to exploit new ecological habitats. Laboratories are designed to introduce students to the major invertebrate groups via observation of living animals and through dissection. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: BIO 150 or BIO 126. Offered alternate years. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category. Counts toward neuroscience concentration."
