		"This course focuses on handling data: visualization, finding patterns, and communicating with data. The primary tools are Python (for transforming data) and R (for visualization and classification). Students work individually and in teams to apply basic principles and explore real-world datasets with a sustainability theme. Prerequisite: calculus or consent of the instructor. Counts toward statistics and mathematical biology concentrations. One of CSCI 121, CSCI 125, CSCI 251counts toward linguistic studies concentration. Offered each semester."
