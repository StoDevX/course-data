		"Data is the currency of the modern world, and data science is a field that sits at the intersection between statistics and computer science. At its heart, data science is about gleaning information and making decisions from data; this course provides a solid foundation to the most important data science tools. Students develop a common language for creating visualizations, wrangling with data, programming in a literate manner, producing reproducible research, and communicating results. Counts toward statistics concentration. Offered each semester."
