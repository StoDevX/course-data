		"Students study Georgia O'Keeffe's New Mexican art, natural and cultural contexts. Three weeks at Ghost Ranch follow a week in Santa Fe with the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and other resources. Discussions, readings, activities, and field trips help students gain insight into the desert as a source of spiritual quest and inspiration to nature writers and artists. They learn about Native American cultures and the region as a place women found liberation and scientists created the atom bomb. Counts toward Art History, Studio Art, American Studies, Environmental Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies majors; and Environmental Studies and Women's and Gender Studies concentrations. Offered Interim 2017-18 only."
