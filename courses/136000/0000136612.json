		"The musical product is an artistic expression; acquiring the skills necessary to make good music depends on the performer's analytical thinking and good time management - also, at times, imagination. This performance-based course will help students develop good practice management skills, working with several strategies and techniques that may enable them to better discern and achieve their musical objectives. Offered periodically during Interim. Prerequisite: permission of instructor."
