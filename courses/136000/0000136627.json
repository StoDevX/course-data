		"This course introduces students to philosophical, methodological, and pedagogical principles developed by 20th-century composer and ethnomusicologist Zolt치n Kod치ly. Students actively engage in aural skills training, movement, instrumental, and creative work. In-depth readings and discussions of historical foundations of the Kod치ly-inspired movement challenge students to critically examine its Euro-centric roots and subsequent connections to 21st-century topics in music. This course is open to music majors and non-majors. Offered annually during the spring semester. Prequisite: MUSIC 112 or MUSIC 114 or permission of the instructor."
