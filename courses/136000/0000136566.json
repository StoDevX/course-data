It aims to discover new theological insights from another or from one's own tradition. This course explores the nature of comparative theology as a method of doing theology. Students read and assess seminal works of comparative theology from the traditions of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam. Offered annually. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
