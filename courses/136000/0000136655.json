		"What is a museum? Is it an impartial space to display and store valued objects that objectively reflect culture, or is it a more complicated organization that evolves and responds to the emerging needs and challenges of individuals and communities? In this course, students explore these questions, consider how museums can be understood as systems of power, and become acquainted with the various roles people play within them. Specific topic varies by instructor. May be repeated if topics differ. Offered alternate years."
