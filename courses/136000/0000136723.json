		"Why are manga/anime so popular? Are they promoting the dominant viewpoint or countering the hegemony? This course critically analyzes manga (comics) and anime (animation). We will learn how manga/anime are studied by academics and its popularity among ordinary people in Japan and beyond. This course also explores constructions of masculinity and femininity and the so-called \"Japaneseness,\" paying attention to linguistic and visual representation. The course format is a combination of lectures, small group/class discussions, student presentations, and multimedia examination. Counts toward Asian Studies & Japanese majors."
