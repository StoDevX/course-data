		"This course examines how women writers from the Nordic region represent gendered identities and sexualities. Using a variety of texts from the nineteenth century to today, students will learn how authors have challenged the socio-political role of women over time. Additionally, students will investigate how authors make use of different literary genres such as dystopian writing, crime fiction, magical realism, or sci-fi to shine a light on gendered identities in society. Offered alternate years during the spring semester. Also counts toward Norwegian and women's and gender studies majors and women's and gender studies concentration. Prerequisite: FYW."
