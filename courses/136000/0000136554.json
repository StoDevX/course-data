		"Students examine water from a scientific perspective -- chemical, physiological, ecological -- and delve into the historical, political, economic, and social implications in Morocco -- a country of diverse cultures and biotic zones from two oceans, mountain ranges, and the driest of dry deserts. Students learn through readings, lectures, student presentations, and field trips. This class is suitable for any student with sophomore standing. Bio 150 OR ENVST 137 highly recommended. Offered during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Also counts toward environmental studies major (natural science elective) and Middle Eastern studies concentration."
