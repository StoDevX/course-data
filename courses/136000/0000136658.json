		"This interdisciplinary course focuses on how the human species creatively apprehends the rest of nature and our environments and has brought our values to bear on environments for good or for ill. The course samples a variety of arts and humanities disciplines structured around a set of nature-oriented and environmental questions and themes. Students sharpen their ability to perceive the world around them in environmentally sound ways through insights offered by various art forms and thinking generated within environmental history, philosophy, religion, and cultural studies. Students undertake work that a) helps them better retain and articulate their multivalent knowledge of culture and nature; and b) challenges them to share such knowledge in a world increasingly needful of healthier connections between people, cultures and the environment. Offered annually."
