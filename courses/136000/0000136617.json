		"Neuroethology is the study of how nervous systems generate natural behaviors in animals. The nervous system connects an animal with its environment, determining how an animal perceives, learns, and reacts to stimuli. This course explores the neural mechanisms underlying diverse behaviors - such as escape reflexes, locomotion, and communication - in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species and based on an evolutionary framework. Lecture concepts are explored through laboratory experimentation and different forms of scientific communication. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered in alternate years with BIO 386 (Animal Behavior). Also counts toward the neuroscience concentration. Prerequisite: MATH 120 or equivalent and one of the following: BIO 233, BIO 247, BIO 266, NEURO 239, or PSYCH 238 or permission of instructor."
