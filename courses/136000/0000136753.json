		"This course explores the playful and challenging ways that electronic mediums can change literature. Hypertext, music, and moving images stretch our ideas of what literature can be, while interactivity changes our relationship with literary forms. During the course, students engage both electronic and traditional texts from poetry, fiction, drama, and even literary games. Students also create and comment on their own electronic literature projects."
