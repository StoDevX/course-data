		"This course provides an introduction to critical concepts and key readings about race and racism that are important to the field of Ethnic Studies. Focusing on identities and communities, students learn about racial formation and difference in U.S. and comparative cultural and historical contexts. How does race intersect with class, gender, nation, and sexuality to produce privileges and oppressions? Students survey the emergence of Ethnic Studies through literary texts including art, creative writing, film, music, popular culture, and/or the sciences to become acquainted with interdisciplinary approaches and how concerns for racial equity and social justice formed this academic field. Offered annually. Also counts toward Latin American studies major and Africa and the African Diaspora and Latin American studies concentrations."
