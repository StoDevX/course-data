		"Students explore anti-racist theologies emerging out of the U.S. context. They investigate historical interactions between religion and race, the role of Christian theology and churches in supporting racial divisions, and how biblical and theological resources can be used to counter racism rather than perpetuate it. Students reflect upon life experiences that have shaped their understandings of race intersecting with religion. The majority of readings will be from authors who are Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color. Offered periodically in the spring semester. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
