		"Often controversial, foreign relations in the Western Hemisphere include not only the political and economic influence of the USA south of its borders, but how states in Latin America and the Caribbean interact with each other and with states and intergovernmental organizations around the world. This course counts toward the Political Science and Latin American Studies majors and the Latin American studies and International Relations cocentrations. Offered periodically during spring semester."
