		"The course begins with a review of cellular physiology and the digestive system, which are the basic components necessary for metabolic processes. Students examine the roles nutrient selection, metabolism, and timing play in supporting physical performance. The integration and regulation of metabolism, energy expenditure, and body composition will be discussed. An advanced overview of the functions of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, fluids, vitamins, and minerals that are determinants of health and diseases will be conducted. Offered annually. Prerequisite: BIO 143 and BIO 243, declared exercise science major."
