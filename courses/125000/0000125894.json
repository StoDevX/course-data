		"How does an entire ensemble of an organism's biochemistry adjust with seasonal or diurnal changes? This course explores the newest thinking about how life has evolved to be fine-tuned to the environment, has managed to populate the range of environments found on earth, and has responded to climate change. Students combine textbook reading with supplemental primary literature and laboratory-based experiences to develop individual research topics, leading to a review paper or symposium. Offered alternate years. Prerequisites: BIO 227 or CH/BI 227 or CHEM 379."
