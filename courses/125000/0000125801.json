		"This course explores dance techniques and styles influenced by the complexity within African art and dance aesthetics, including polyrhythm, polycentrism, and ephebism. Students investigate these African aesthetic retentions through the study and fusion of three African diasporic forms which include West African, Hip Hip, and Dunham. Students investigate the idea and politics surrounding \"fusion,\" specifically in the United States of America. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisites: DANCE 112 or permission of instructor."
