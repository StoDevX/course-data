		"A wide array of techniques is used to answer fundamental questions about how the brain and nervous system work in the expression of behavior. Through readings, discussion, and hands-on laboratory experiences students examine various research methods in behavioral neuroscience, considering the strengths and weaknesses of each. Emphasis is placed on ethical considerations of animal research and the application of basic science data to human problems.Topics may include feeding behavior, drug-seeking, and pain perception. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230, plus NEURO 239 or PSYCH 238."
