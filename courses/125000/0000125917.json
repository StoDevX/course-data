		"After the Second World War, Britain experienced a surge in immigration from the Caribbean, South Asia, and Africa, a crucial step in the transformation of Britain into a multiracial, multicultural nation. Over the past several decades, these immigrants and their descendants have crafted distinct bodies of work in literature, film, music, and visual art. This course is a broad, multi-genre introduction to their work with particular emphasis on its historical and cultural context. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW."
