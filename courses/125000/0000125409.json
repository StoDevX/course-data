	"description": [
		"From legalized marijuana, to the widespread use of antidepressants and antianxiety medications, to the ubiquitious presence of coffee shops, the \"drug culture\" affects nearly everyone in our society. This course introduces the world of psychopharmacology, with an emphasis on the basic neural mechanisms underlying the effects of drugs, including their portrayal in popular movies and music. By learning how drugs can affect the way neurons communicate, students become more thoughtful consumers. Prerequisites: PSYCH 125 or PSYCH 238 or any Level I Biology, Chemistry or Chemistry/Biology course. Offered periodically during Interim."
