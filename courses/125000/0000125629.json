		"This course examines the US-Mexico border (construed physically and abstractly) as a site of religious engagement, reflecting on analyses of the border as both a political construct and a racial one that shapes the idea of \"American\" identity. Students consider diverse religious views, including those who cross the border, those left behind, those who live near it, and those who fear and want to end its permeability. This course includes an ethnographic component. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
