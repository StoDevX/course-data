		"Economic statecraft refers to states' use of economic means to pursue foreign policy goals and political ends. This seminar provides students with advanced study of economic statecraft tools, which often combine economic rewards and punishments. Specifically, students explore when and how governments choose from their economic statecraft repertoire, and assess the effectiveness of the available tools, including but not limited to foreign aid, bilateral trade and investment, and economic sanctions. Offered annually in the fall semester. Prerequisite: PSCI 220 and one course in the international relations subfield or permission of the instructor."
