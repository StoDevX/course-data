		"Students in this course learn and apply economic analysis, tempered by an appreciation for the political and institutional contexts of the less developed countries, to gain an understanding of these countries' economies.

Offered annually. Also counts toward environmental studies (social science emphasis) and Latin American studies majors and Latin Amrican studies concentration. Prerequisite: one of ECON 110-121 or permission of instructor."
