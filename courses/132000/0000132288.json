		"This course introduces students to the subject of machine learning. The primary focus is the development and application of powerful machine learning algorithms applied to complex, real-world data. Topics covered include linear regression, nearest neighbor models, k-means clustering, shrinkage methods, decision trees and forests, boosting, bagging, support vector machines, and hierarchical clustering. Applications are taken from a wide variety of disciplines, including biology, economics, public policy, public health, and sports. Familiarity with a programming language such as R or Python is highly recommended. Offered on a regular basis. Counts toward computer science and mathematics majors and statistics and data science concentration. Prerequisite: MATH 220, CSCI 251, or STAT 272 or permission of the instructor."
