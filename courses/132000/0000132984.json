		"With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. In this discussion-based course, students use published research findings to examine the connections between the symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, biochemistry, and physiology. Offered periodically. Also counts toward neuroscience concentration. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230 and PSYCH 247, and PSYCH 238 or NEURO 239."
