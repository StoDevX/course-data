		"Students learn basic techniques to analyze, manage, visualize, and model data. Instruction focuses on the analysis of \"real,\" salient datasets in a computer-equipped classroom. In small groups students discuss, analyze, and solve case study-based problems. Class sessions include the Inquiry-Based Learning technique, which engages students in frequent presentations of their solutions to the class. Students use the R statistical software to perform statistical computing and data visualizations. Offered annually."
