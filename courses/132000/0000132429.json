		"Neuroscience is one of the fastest-growing fields in the sciences, with research interests ranging from molecular genetics to whole animal behavior. Topics include membrane biophysics, synaptic transmission and plasticity, intracellular signaling, sensory transduction, motor control systems, and development. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward biology and exercise science majors and mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 143 or CH/BI 227 or BIO 227 or PSYCH 238."
