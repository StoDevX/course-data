	"description": [
		"This course builds on an existing understanding of alignment, coordination, and polyrhythm to introduce more mentally and physically difficult movements and a broad vocabulary. Developing a performance range is emphasized. The course demands an intermediate sense of kinesthetic awareness, efficient athleticism, and embodied familiarity with movement influenced by the African Diaspora. Floor work, inversions, and improvisation may be included. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: DANCE 112 or permission of instructor."
