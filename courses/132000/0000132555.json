		"Students examine contemporary issues in Germany such as national politics, environmental sustainability, diversity and migration, and the legacy of the GDR. They compare multiple perspectives on these issues by reading, discussing, and analyzing diverse expository texts including (auto)biographical writings, journalistic articles, and critical essays. Coursework includes writing assignments and oral presentations that emphasize textual analysis with a focus on texts' strategic organization, argumentative structure, style, content, and layers of critical voices. Advanced grammar review supports analytical tasks. Taught in German. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward management studies concentration. Prerequisite: GERM 232 or by placement test."
