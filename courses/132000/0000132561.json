This cultural analysis provides for the development of critical reading and writing skills (e.g., description, narration, exposition, and argumentation). Taught in Spanish. Offered each semester. Also counts toward women's and gender studies and Latin American studies majors and family studies and women's and gender studies concentrations. Prerequisite: SPAN 232 or placement into SPAN 250."
