		"Students examine the influence of race, class, and multiculturalism in American schools by participating as teachers' assistants and tutors in two distinctly different K-12 schools. Students discover the challenges and benefits associated with teaching in a diverse racial, cultural, and socio-economic environment. Through guest lectures, readings, field trips, and seminars, students learn about the truly unique geographic and cultural setting of the Hawaiian islands. This environment makes an excellent framework from which to examine race, ethnicity, power, and privilege in U.S. schools. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Intended for educational studies concentrators and licensure students; cannot fulfill the Interim requirement for TEFL certification. Offered alternate Interims, even years. Apply through the Education Department. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Prerequisite: EDUC 260 and EDUC 290, or EDUC 330."
