		"This course introduces a variety of documents (both literary and artistic) to investigate cultural interactions between ancient Greece and the East in the first millennium BCE. By studying the mythological Trojan War, the Persian War, and Alexander the Great's decade of campaigns, students consider how the ancient Greeks related to the alien cultures with which they were in continual contact: what did it mean to be \"Greek\" or \"barbarian\" in the ancient world? Offered periodically during Interim. Counts towards ancient studies major."
