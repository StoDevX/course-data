		"This course explores the Hip Hop dance canon through Party Dance technique, and styles under the umbrella of Hip Hop. Beginning where Hip Hop I ends, it focuses on rhythm, groove, and extends into complex footwork. As an intermediate level course, these foci are explored intricately and in-depth, with expectations that students work toward intellectual and clear kinesthetic comprehension exhibited in the body through performance. Students will investigate the influence of Hip Hop as a genre on various cultures through the study of street dance technique. Prerequisite: Dance 113."
