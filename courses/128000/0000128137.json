		"Liberalism is one of the world’s dominant political philosophies—and has been for several centuries. And yet there has been little agreement over its meaning, scope, or validity. This course studies liberalism's philosophical history, maps its contours, examines its varieties and considers several of its critics. We will read a range of texts representing major historical and contemporary expressions of liberalism and significant critiques of liberalism."
