		"This course explores research on parenting and child development across a variety of diverse family structures and sociocultural contexts, including families with primary caregiving fathers, divorced and remarried parents, adoptive parents, gay and lesbian parents. Students discuss similarities and variability across families, and examine how factors such as gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity and social class shape parenting experiences and unique psychosocial challenges that \"nontraditional\" families may confront. Students examine and bridge the empirical literature with popular culture and media portrayals of families. Offered periodically. Also counts toward women's and gender studies major and educational studies, family studies, and women's and gender studies concentrations. Prerequisite: PSYCH 241; PSYCH 230 is strongly recommended."
