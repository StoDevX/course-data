		"Shakespeare's statement, \"all the world's a stage,\" has never been more true, as his plays have truly become global texts. This course charts some of their journeys. Students study four or five of Shakespeare's plays and use concepts from adaptation studies to analyze various \"Shakespeares\" that have emerged across the globe, including translations, new plays, films, manga, and other re-mediations. Students will attend at least one performance; a ticket fee is required. Prerequisite: WRI 111 or equivalent."
