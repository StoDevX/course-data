		"Students examine the influence of race, class, and multiculturalism in American schools by participating as teachers' assistants and tutors in two distinctly different K-12 schools. Students discover the challenges and benefits associated with teaching in a diverse racial, cultural, and socio-economic environment. Through guest lectures, readings, field trips, and seminars, students learn about the truly unique geographic and cultural setting of the Hawaiian islands. This environment makes an excellent framework from which to examine race, ethnicity, power, and privilege in U.S. schools. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Offered alternate Interims, even years. Counts toward American studies and race and ethnic studies majors and race and ethnic studies concentration. Prerequisite: EDUC 260 and EDUC 290, or EDUC 330."
