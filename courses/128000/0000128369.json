		"Why is language-based discrimination unnoticed and widely justified? This course explores roles of language in society with respect to equity and diversity by using the notion of language ideologies and language practices for negotiating identities. Students connect recent scholarship on language ideology and practices to their daily experiences. The course format is a combination of lectures, small group/class discussions, student presentations, and examination of multimedia. Offered periodically."
