		"Intercultural Communication in Context combines a pre-departure reading/reflection assignment, 3 weeks abroad with on of three CIEE programs, and a final week of on-campus class, that draws upon the off-campus learning content and applies intercultural communication theory and reflective practices. Students reflect on their experiences abroad, discuss global systems that connect learning in each context, and engage in discussions of movements and identities across borders. Prerequisites: none for Intercultural Communication course; prerequisites for CIEE courses will vary by course."
