		"Confucius, Buddha, and Socrates are foundational philosophers of the ancient world. Yet, Socrates holds a privileged position in the history of philosophy due to his emphasis on reason, argumentation, and his influence on Plato. In this course students take a comparative approach to the philosophies of these three thinkers with the aim of examining their method of practicing philosophy, analyzing their philosophical theories, and investigating what it is to be a philosopher in each of their cultures. Also counts toward Asian studies major and concentration. Offered annually."
