		"Government action affects us all. We pay taxes; we use public roads, schools, and parks. Some prices we pay are lower due to government subsidies; others are higher due to taxes. Government actions influence both the efficiency of our economy and the equity and equality within our society. Students learn valuable analytical tools for evaluating public projects, tax policies, entitlement programs and voting behavior. Prerequisite: Economics 262 and Statistics 263 or Statistics 272, completion of BTS-T, or permission of instructor. Offered most years. Counts towards American studies major."
