		"Students explore the topic of family and society in the Spanish-speaking world and develop critical reading skills by analyzing cultural documents (literary and non-literary texts, including at least one substantive literary work). This cultural analysis provides for extensive writing (e.g., description, narration, exposition, and argumentation). Taught in Spanish. Prerequisite: Spanish 232 or placement into Spanish 250. Offered each semester. Counts toward family studies concentration."
