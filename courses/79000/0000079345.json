They consolidate their language skills and continue to develop their ability to analyze and communicate in Spanish by writing compositions, making oral presentations, and engaging in interactive group activities. They also review Spanish structures difficult for speakers of English. Prerequisite: Spanish 231 or placement. Offered each semester."
