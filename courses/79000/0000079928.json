		"This course introduces students to the historical forces leading to and scholarly debates about slavery in African history. Students examine the nature and development of domestic slavery to the 19th century as well as the slave trade systems across the Saharan Desert and the Atlantic Ocean. Students \"do history\" using primary sources to retrieve the African voices and agency in discussions of the slave trade and debating themes such as ethnicity, kinship, state formation, and colonialism. For first-year students only. Offered annually."
