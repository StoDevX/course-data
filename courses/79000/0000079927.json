		"Students gain a hands-on understanding of concepts discussed in class readings, both musical and social, by playing in the gamelan, a Southeast Asian gong and percussion ensemble. This course aims to allow students to understand the political and historical framework that underlies Indonesian musical cultures through targeted reading and written responses and to explore how these frameworks are replicated in musical sound through intensive in-class listening and participation in a gamelan ensemble. No previous musical experience expected."
