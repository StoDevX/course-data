	"desc": "This course helps students explore the connections between society and their own lives. Students answer challenging questions such as \"Do we have a 'human nature'?,\" \"Why does social inequality exist?,\" \"What is race?,\" and \"How do societies change?\" In answering these questions students learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing so they review the various research methods and theories that form the sociological tradition. This course is primarily open to first year students or students in certain accredited programs. Open to first-year students only. Open to all students when taught during the summer. Offered each semester.",
