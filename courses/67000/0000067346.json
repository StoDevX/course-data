	"desc": "Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields, with activity ranging from the fundamentals of behavior to molecular aspects of neuronal function. This course provides a foundation and overview of the important and extensive ways in which biological and physiological processes are involved in the regulation and maintenance of behavior. Among the topics students explore are: fundamental electrophysiology, sensory and motor systems, integration, and learning and memory. Counts towards the Biology and Psychology majors. Prerequisites: Biology 125, or Chemistry 121 (or 125), or Chemistry/Biology 125, or Physics 130, or Psychology 125. Biology 125 is strongly recommended. Offered annually in the Fall Semester.",
