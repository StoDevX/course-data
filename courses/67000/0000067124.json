		"Human health is affected both by our biological environment, a teaming world of parasites and diseases, and our physical environment, the water, air, and landscapes that we inhabit. Our interactions with the environment have changed rapidly, as human populations grow, travel increases, and ecosystems are altered. This course touches upon traditional environmental topics such as air and water quality, with integrating newer public health challenges such as emerging diseases and food-borne illnesses. Prerequisite: An introductory science course."
