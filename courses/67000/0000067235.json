Diverse examples are drawn from literature -- Love in the Driest Season, The Color of Water, A Poison Stronger than Love and from students' autobiographies. Prerequisites: Sociology 121, Psychology 241, and Biology 123 or 243; open to non-majors by permission of chair only. Offered annually in the Fall Semester."
