		"This introduction to dance allows students broadly to experience and learn about dance. Students explore dance from the following perspectives: historical, cultural and social, creative and expressive, performing, critical and aesthetic, and kinesthetic. Lectures, experiential movement labs, group presentations, and viewing of both live and recorded dance performances are all components of the course. No dance experience required. A ticket/transportation fee will be collected. Offered annually in the Fall Semester."
