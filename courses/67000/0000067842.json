		"This seminar considers artistic censorship in the 20th and 21st centuries in light of the major moral theories, principles, and approaches to Western ethics. Students explore the recent history of censorship in the arts, and examine art through the lens of ethics, considering the nature of art and artistic power. Why is art censored? Who censors? Is there an ethics of art? An ethics of censorship? Is there an ethical response to censorship? To art?"
