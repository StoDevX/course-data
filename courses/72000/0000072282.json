Students explore maps, histories, tales, and guides that define Asia today and in years past, including at least one of the classic Asian texts; study how cultural, linguistic, economic, religious, social, and political connections and divisions create and sustain communities in Asia; spend the last few weeks of the term planning related projects for their interim course. Prerequisite: Chinese 112 or Japanese 112 or permission of instructor. Offered annually in the fall semester."
