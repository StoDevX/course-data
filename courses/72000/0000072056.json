	"desc": "Mathematical logic uses mathematical methods to analyze reasoning and to examine what mathematics can and cannot do. It also provides the underlying paradigm on which intelligent computer systems are based. Initially, students study the language and rules of inference of predicate logic and investigate the relationships between provability and truth and between a mathematical theory and its models. Later, they explore applications of logic to computer science. Prerequisite: Mathematics 244 or 252. Offered periodically.",
