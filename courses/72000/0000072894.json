		"In this reflective capstone course, teacher candidates reflect upon the influences that technology, cultural diversity, personal health, and chemical abuse have upon schooling, home life, community stability, and, ultimately, their own students' achievement. Student teachers examine school governance and administration, finance, contemporary issues, and employment preparation. Students build upon student teaching to determine the essential knowledge and skills of educators as change agents and their future roles as first-year teachers. This workshop follows student teaching. Student teachers only. Offered each semester."
