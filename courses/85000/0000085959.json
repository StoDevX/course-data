Students study classic theological treatments of sexuality, with attention to the tensions among divergent appraisals of sex; and they study contemporary theological discussions about subjects that have given rise to controversy, such as marriage, gender, same-sex relations, family, or commodification. Focus for 2012-13: Sexuality in Jewish and Christian theology. Prerequisite: BTS-B. Counts toward women's and gender studies major and concentration."
