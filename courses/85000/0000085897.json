Issues covered include the characteristics of the Japanese language, loan words, regional differences, politeness, gender differences, and communication styles. The course is taught in a combination of lectures, class discussions, subtitled Japanese films, anime (Japanese animation), and student presentations. There are no prerequisites for 126; knowledge of Japanese helpful but not necessary. Readings, lectures, and discussions are all in English."
