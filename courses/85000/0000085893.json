		"The most exciting art forms today are interdisciplinary. The boundaries between the fine arts disciplines of visual art, music, dance, and theater are now seen as completely permeable. This course allows students to combine visual art making with movement, sound, and performance to create spectacle. The course emphasizes process and collaboration incorporating readings, discussion, critiques, field trips, guest artists, and studio practice. Prerequisite: one full-credit course in art, music, dance, or theatre, or the equivalent as approved by instructor. Materials/field trip fee. Offered every two to three years."
