		"Igor Stravinsky said that film music should have \"the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading.\" In this seminar, students encounter an art that can have devastating emotional impact while often remaining unnoticed. Students achieve a broad understanding of the history of music in cinema and create new film music in team-based collaborations. No music background or other prerequisites required."
