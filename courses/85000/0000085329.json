	"desc": "After the Second World War, Britain experienced a surge in immigration from the Caribbean, South Asia, and Africa, a crucial step in the transformation of Britain into a multiracial, multicultural nation.

This course is a broad, multi-genre introduction to this work with particular emphasis on its historical and cultural context. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. Offered in alternate years.",
