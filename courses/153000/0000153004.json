		"This course examines the relationship between literature as a form of cultural expression and capitalism as a mode of economic production. Understanding literatureâ€™s response to capitalism over the last two-and-a-half centuries requires interdisciplinary study. This course thus seeks to contextualize the transformations of literature and capitalism by reading in the fields of political economy, sociology, political theory, critical race studies, advertising and marketing, visual art, and film."
