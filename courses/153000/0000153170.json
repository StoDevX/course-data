		"What does it mean to belong to a group, and how do ideas about individuality contribute to collective identity? Are groups just aggregates of their individual parts, or can the sum be greater? Is it possible for groups to have their own collective beliefs or responsibilities (distinct from those of their individual constituents)? Is group identity a choice or can you belong to a group without intending to do so? To what extent do group members have to agree on what their collective identity is? What kind of criteria are used for inclusion and exclusion and the maintenance of boundaries? Students in this seminar will reflect on and study different kinds of groups, including social cliques, musical groups, sports teams (and their fans), fortune 500 corporations, religious cults, nation-states, prairie ecosystems, and even college campuses."
