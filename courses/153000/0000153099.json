		"Students explore German history from the Enlightenment, through the establishment of a modern German nation-state (1871), up to the post-WWII German-German state division (1949). Through the examination of primary sources in English translation, comparative historiography, and ethical theories, students consider the ethical implications of revolutionary--that is, society-shifting--movements and the ethics of history-writing in and about modern Germany. Students hone skills of interpretation and argumentation in writing and speaking. Offered periodically. Counts toward History and German majors and German Studies concentration."
