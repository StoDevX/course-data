		"Movement and dance encourages the exploration of complex ideas through investigation, knowledge, and expression of the body. Dance embodies both historical and cultural values and also awakens new perceptions which help you learn and think in new ways. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the role of movement and dance as a vital form of human expression, understanding, communication, and interaction. Come and be \"moved\" by the power of dance. This seminar will involve lecture, discussion, and several experiential movement labs. No dance experience required."
