		"Who are my ancestors and how did they live? This family history workshop enables students to explore their roots and place their ancestors' experiences in historical context. Working primarily with online databases, students construct genealogies and employ archival sources to tell richer stories about family history of marriage and child rearing, migration, and work, while situating them within contemporary social and political contexts. Students communicate their findings by writing a family narrative or by composing an ArcGIS Story Map."
