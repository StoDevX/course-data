		"How have Europeans understood Black Africans and Jews? This course explores intellectual, social, cultural, and political history of human differences and how concepts of race, ethnicity, and nation developed and evolved. Beginning with the arrival of Africans in Europe's lavish courts in the 16th century and moving to present-day antisemitism and Islamophobia, we examine sources from philosophers, abolitionists, enslaved people, anthropologists, politicians, migrants, and propagandists. This course comes with a trigger warning: offensive words and phrases and negative graphic depictions are part of course content and discussions as part of learning the historical context."
