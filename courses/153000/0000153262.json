		"This course shows students how anthropologists and economists approach the broad category of health care. Students explore how the two social sciences define health, conceptualize institutions, build accountability into systems, and treat the maladies of complex human beings. While the course highlights differences between the two disciplines, it also considers where they overlap. Offered periodically."
