		"This interdisciplinary seminar introduces students to critical and cultural texts written by authors of color to name the complex politics of race, gender, and sexuality. Students develop intersectionality as an analytical tool with which to understand how systems of interlocking oppression have marginalized women and LGBTQ people of color. Readings emphasize literary and cultural representations as acts of resistance to racial gender violence, racial homophobia, policing and militarization, and global economic inequality. Offered annually. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration."
