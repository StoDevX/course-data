		"This course offers a survey of key issues and developments in LGBTQ studies with a central emphasis on the co-constitution (the intersectionality) of sexuality, race, class, geographic location, and gender identities, and the contributions of writers of the African diaspora and the postcolonial world to queer-of-color thinking and being. Thus, while the class considers the ways that European thinkers have developed a dominant discursive context for thinking about sexuality and gender difference in the West and the academy, students learn to center the thinking of queer-of-color critics and the Global South as a site of critical knowledge making. The class explores what it means to challenge, disrupt, or complicate the conceits to universalism visible in what postcolonial and ethnic queer of color writers name \"mainstream\" queer theory."
