		"Students examine a range of plays by Shakespeare with particular attention to the material goods that appear in them as well as the material conditions of early modern performance and textual production. Students will investigate how objects matter in the plays: how they construct gender, class and racial identities, or create a sense of space, time and location. In addition to analysis of the play texts and some productions, assignments will include practical work with early recipes, artifacts, and rare books housed on campus and in the Twin Cities."
