		"This course explores \"the history of the body,\" a multidisciplinary field of research dedicated to exploring and historicizing how humans have conceptualized and imagined the body in sickness and in health. Scholars of this field seek to problematize modern assumptions and classificatory systems about the human body by asking questions inspired by anthropology, cultural history, decolonization studies and gender studies. Questions such as \"When and why did scientists become interested in the classification of differences in human bodies?\" and \"How did midwives and folk healers understand health, birth, and sickness before the advent of modern means of seeing the internal body?\" animate this seminar. Inspired by historians in this field, this course approaches the past as a foreign country, assuming that every time and place had its own internal logic and competing understandings of the body and its meanings. Other historical topics explored include the child's body, disabilities, mental health, beauty, body size, \"dangerous\" bodies, race, sexuality and colonialism and decolonization. Students will apply methodologies from the history of the body to produce their own research projects. Intended for juniors and seniors with some background in history. Counts toward History and GSS majors."
