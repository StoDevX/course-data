		"What does the perfect world look like and what conditions would transform it into a nightmare? Answers to these questions will vary from person to person and across time and space, as seen in works of utopia and dystopia like Thomas More's Utopia, Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed, or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Students in this course explore a selection of such writings. Considering what others have sought or feared when designing fictional worlds builds a foundation for exploring our own political desires and goals. The utopias and dystopias thus serve as reflective tools for analyzing the ethical and political values of our world. Students critically examine what we consider to be \"normal\" in society while also imagining possible alternative futures. Through class conversations and assignments, students further reflect on what it means to inhabit a community of shared political and moral vision."
