		"The popularity of science fiction stems from both its speculations about the future and what it tells us about the present. In this seminar, we will explore the temporal fluidity of science fiction along with many of its other generic features, including plots, settings, characters, ideological perspectives, and explanations of science and technology. Students will read and write about sci-fi novels and short stories by influential authors from H.G. Wells to Kim Stanley Robinson. Considering the importance of cinema to the sci-fi genre, the seminar will also host a number of screenings. The course is likely to include Wellsâ€™s War of the Worlds, Isaac Asimov's I, Robot, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Octavia E. Butler's Parable of the Sower, along with film classics such as A Trip to the Moon, 2001, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, and Arrival. Finally , Students will read scholarly texts on both specific works and the sci-fi genre as a whole."
