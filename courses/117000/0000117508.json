		"This course introduces students to North American archaeological field techniques and methods such as survey, site identification, artifact processing and analysis, photogrammetry, and site excavation. During a 21-day summer session, students work with indigenous community leaders to recognize artifacts and contextualize them in local and regional traditions; practice and refine excavation and survey techniques; and critically examine how archaeological knowledge about North American Indigenous Peoples is constructed and expressed. Offered alternate years during summer."
