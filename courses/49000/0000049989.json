		"This three-semester calculus-based sequence leads the student through the quarter millennium of the basic principles that account for the processes involved in baseballs, car engines, electrical power distribution systems, stereos and black holes. It is the starting point for a major in physics and is also appropriate for majors in fields such as chemistry or mathematics who desire more mathematical depth than would be used in the two-semester 124-125 sequence."
