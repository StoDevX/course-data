		"Through reading and discussion of a diversity of plays and through the study of dramatic events such as play-acting and ritual, students identify the characteristics of drama as a genre within a social context and discuss the plays as literary forms, as ideas and as performance. The course is appropriate for non-majors with broad interests. May be repeated if topics are different"
