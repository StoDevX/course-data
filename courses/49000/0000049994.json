		"This lab course exposes students to the practice of modern analytical chemistry. Although experiments change from year to year, students have hands-on experience using spectrophotometers, pH meters, liquid chromatographs and computer interfacing. Experiments typically utilize products and/or materials that are environmentally or industrially important. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in Chemistry 255. P/N only. Offered both semesters."
