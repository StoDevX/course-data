		"Why does human life involve suffering? If God is omnipotent and good, why does evil exist? Is God responsible, or can all evil -- and the suffering that accompanies it -- be explained by sin or human frailty. Students will explore some of the ways that Christian theology had attempted to respond to these questions, and they will also examine challenges to the Christian perspective."
