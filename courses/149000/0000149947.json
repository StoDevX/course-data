		"This whirlwind introduction comprehensively examines foundational principles, theoretical approaches, and major areas of study within psychology. Acting as skeptical scientists, students gain another lens on the human experience by which they can better understand themselves and others. Students see psychology as a science and challenge \"common sense\" explanations about how people function. This gateway course captures the essence of the liberal arts, applying to almost any career choice. Offered each semester. Also counts toward nursing, social studies education, and social work majors and educational studies concentration."
