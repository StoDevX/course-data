		"Why do people disagree so deeply about public policies concerning gun control, healthcare, the environment, and abortion? Why are politics and public affairs more generally so controversial in the USA? This seminar emphasizes the historical, political, moral and religious underpinnings of our most important policy conversations and considers how to have successful disagreements about the things that really matter. Students will reflect not only on the meaning of this country's founding documents, but also what it means to be a critical thinker in the present, and what to do when oneâ€™s own ideals of freedom, equality, democracy, authority, and community are challenged or seem to be in tension."
