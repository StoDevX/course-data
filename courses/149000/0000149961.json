		"Students explore the continuing significance of color, class, and immigration in the U.S., with a focus on the experiences and concerns of African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian-Americans. The course examines the nature and functions of prejudice; the relationship among race, class and gender; the persistence of racism and inequality; and social policies and social movements intended to create greater social justice. Offered annually in the fall or spring semester. Also counts toward Latin American studies and race and ethnic studies majors; and Africa and the African Diaspora, educational studies, Latin American studies, management studies, and race and ethnic studies concentrations."
