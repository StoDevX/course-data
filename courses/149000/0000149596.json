		"This course introduces students to the C++ programming language and common data structures. Students develop their understanding of how machines store and operate on data, down to the individual bits. Students learn about storage space and run-time requirements of common data structures, including stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees. Combined with their deeper understanding of how the computer processes data, students analyze programs for efficiency and to apply the right data structure for specific scenarios. Offered each semester. Prerequisite: CSCI 121 or CSCI 125 or equivalent or permission of instructor."
