		"This course introduces students to the concepts of Folk Schools, which originated in the Nordic countries in the mid-nineteenth century. Students apply many of the original philosophies of folk schools as they learn skills such as blacksmithing, Scandinavian spoon carving, needlework, sour dough break making, belt loom weaving, and soap making. The course focuses on process, object making, skill building, and true experiential learning, with an emphasis on bringing the sculptural art object into the everyday. The course takes place in the newly completed Flaten Art Barn. Guest artists and craftspeople demonstrate and work with students and also lecture on their craft or art form. A field trip to the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum adds to the experience. The course includes lectures on the rich history of folk schools, their value and relevance in today's culture, and environmentalism as it relates to daily living. Counts as elective toward studio art major and Nordic studies concentration."
