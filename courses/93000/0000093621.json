		"Students examine expository texts such as (auto)biographical writings, journalistic articles, and critical essays, with an eye to understanding the strategic organization of the text, the information presented, and the various layers of critical voices in a text.

The course is designed to teach students writing strategies and the final project is a short paper written in German. Taught in German.
