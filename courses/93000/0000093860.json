		"This course focuses on principles of pharmacology and care of the hospitalized adult including communication skills. Topics include pain management, sleep and rest, diabetes, antiinfectives, and perioperative care. Students apply the nursing process to the care of adults, with emphasis on the elderly. Using a holistic perspective, students collect and analyze information related to a individual's health status. Students begin to develop the professional role of caregiver and patient advocate. Clinical experiences are provided in a variety of settings serving adult and elderly populations, as well as in simulation. Prerequisites: concurrent registration in NURS 302, NURS 304, and NURS 306. Offered annually in the fall semester."
