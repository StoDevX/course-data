		"Nordic literature of today features writers with immigrant backgrounds, many from non-Western countries. These translingual and multicultural writers present narratives that negotiate identity and appropriate new homelands, and thus rewrite what is means to be Nordic. Students examine literature that represents the immigrant experience in present-day Scandinavia in relation to the experience of immigrants to the U.S. in the 19th century and within the international context of global migration in today's world. Counts toward Nordic studies concentration."
