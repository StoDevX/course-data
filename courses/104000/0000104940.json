	"description": "The Soul of Stuff: Arts, Culture, and Ethics \u00ad Artifacts, dolls, souls, trash. This team\u00ad taught course combines perspectives from history, literature, and management to ask why do we collect stuff? Why does stuff matter? Does it possess its own soul, or does culture endow it with meaning? Why does some stuff remain valuable while much becomes garbage? Explore these questions and others through active learning practices such as making artifacts, collecting them for a museum, and reflecting through analytical and creative writing opportunities.",
