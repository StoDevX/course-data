		"The California Dream is an intensification of the American Dream. In this course we'll explore the special role that California has played and continues to play in our culture. Depending on where you're from, what you believe in, and what you might desire, \"California\" is either paradise or hell, a text on which Americans project their fantasies and fears. We'll read about crucial historical events that shaped myths, and current events that \"could only happen in California.\" We'll consider the importance of landscape and region. We'll examine the gold rush and Silicon Valley, Hollywood and water, the border issues of the \"tortilla curtain,\" environmental matters. Weâ€™ll conclude by speculating about two subjects: one, why the future face of the United States might look much like California does now; and two, why much of the world conceives of the United States (as the Dream, as Satan) as Americans have conceived of California."
