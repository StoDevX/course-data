	"description": "Students study, make, activate, and play with objects. The physically animated object has long fascinated humans. From childhood toys, to props and puppets in performances and adult gadgets and tools, objects have their own life often beyond pure utility. The course explores the ways in which the metaphoric life of objects often emerges from the transgressive act of playing with things you are not supposed to play with.",
