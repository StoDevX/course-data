	"desc": "This interdisciplinary course explores the S\u00e1mi, an indigenous people living mainly in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Students first place the S\u00e1mi in a historical-cultural context by examining the S\u00e1mi's social and economic systems, religion, customs, and values. The major portion of the course examines the S\u00e1mi primarily from within: the S\u00e1mi will present themselves through their literature, film, music, and art. Taught in English. Offered periodically. Counts toward linguistic studies concentration.",
