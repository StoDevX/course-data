	"desc": "20TH CENTURY AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE DEATH OF THE DREAM. The recent economic downturn\u0097what many have called a collapse\u0097has raised concerns regarding the financial health of future generations. It is now widely accepted that the potential for younger Americans to do better than previous generations\u0097the narrative of social mobility popularly understood as the American Dream\u0097is no longer a reality. Instead, there is a growing consensus regarding the death of this dream and with it the very possibility to improve one\u0092s economic, social, and cultural condition. It seems that rather than progressing toward a healthy democracy, the United States has spiraled into a science fiction reality where the media controls our thinking, politics is governed by self-interest, and corporations are powerful enough to hire private armies to impose their will around the globe. This seminar centers on twentieth century American culture, particularly as it relates to issues of historical progress, national identity, cultural change, and aesthetic experimentation. The main question we will address is \u0093What has happened to the American Dream?\u0094 In addition to literature, we will also read some philosophical and political texts. Requirements will include short writing assignments, a mid-term paper, and a final paper. Some of the texts we will discuss include The Yellow Wallpaper, as well as films like There Will Be Blood, The Corporation, Revolutionary Road, and Fight Club.",
