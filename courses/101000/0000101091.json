		"Regenerative Medicine is an emerging field with exciting implications for the study and treatment of human disease. In this course, we will explore the genetics of nuclear reprogramming, the generation of bioengineered stem cells, and the complexity of cellular differentiation. This seminar- style course will focus on primary literature review, including small-group journal club presentations and discussion. Students will also have the opportunity to research the role of regenerative medicine advances in a disease of interest. Small groups will present their findings in a written review and an oral presentation. Prerequisite: Bio 233 or permission of instructor."
