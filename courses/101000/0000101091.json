In this course, we will explore the genetics of nuclear reprogramming, the generation of bioengineered stem cells, and the complexity of cellular differentiation. This seminar- style course will focus on primary literature review, including small-group journal club presentations and discussion. Students will also have the opportunity to research the role of regenerative medicine advances in a disease of interest. Small groups will present their findings in a written review and an oral presentation. Prerequisite: Bio 233 or permission of instructor.",
