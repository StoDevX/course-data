		"CRITICAL LITERACY. This seminar has a special emphasis on reading, writing, and thinking through the lens of critical literacy: how we acquire language, how we use language, how language uses us. It will not be a strict nuts and bolts approach to the writing and language practices that will be expected of you at St. Olaf, though rest assured, these practices will be discussed. More importantly, we will learn to gain agency both in and out of higher education by purposely shaping our language for particular rhetorical situations. Choosing our words carefully is both an act of rebellion and leadership, and by doing so we will together become better readers, writers, and stewards of the English language."
