	"desc": "THE BIBLE IN THE AGE OF FERGUSON: The shooting of an unarmed 18 year-old black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, MO, August 9th, 2014, by white police officer Darren Wilson re-sparked nationwide conversations about race in the U.S. Questions about systemic racial injustice, policing, white privilege, and culture entered the public in ways both old and new, from protests invoking \u0093Hands up, Don\u0092t shoot\u0094 to the Black Lives Matter movement. This section of 121 takes these current conversations about race and racial injustice as a starting point. We will work through contemporary cultural biblical studies and engage contemporary critical race theory along the way. Alongside biblical texts, we\u0092ll read poets like Claudia Rankine and her prophetic lyric Citizen, Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me, womanist scholarship like Kelly Brown Douglas' Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God, and theologian James Cone\u0092s most recent work, The Cross and the Lynching Tree.",
