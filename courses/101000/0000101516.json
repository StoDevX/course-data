		"PAGE, STAGE, AND SCREEN: TELLING STORIES. This seminar will explore three media (literature, theater, and film) and two genres (comedy and tragedy), by way of thinking about the structures and strategies of fictional narratives. What human themes/experiences/ideas in these stories are \"universal\"? What is distinctive about the ways they can be communicated by each of the three media? In each medium, we’ll explore texts both classic (Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice) and contemporary (a film by Spike Lee; contemporary fiction by a Northfield-based writer with a national reputation). Our class will attend two staged theater productions (professional theater in Minneapolis/St. Paul and a St. Olaf production). We’ll read novels both comic and tragic and watch films ranging from a 1930s screwball comedy to a contemporary urban tragedy. Writing assignments, formal and informal, will be frequent and varied, and will include visual analyses both of theatrical staging and film techniques, critical literary analysis, a research paper on film history, and a \"creative\" opportunity to try your hand at screenwriting."
