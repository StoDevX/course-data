		"In this course, students examine how schools and communities in the Twin Cities interact to provide support and developmental opportunities for school-age children. Through lectures, readings, discussions, field trips, and in-school and co-curricular placements, students gain an understanding and awareness of how race, class, ethnicity, national origin, and gender shape the complex character of urban youth and schools. Students spend one week in orientation activities on campus and two weeks in the Twin Cities. During the time in the Twin Cities, St. Olaf students participate as tutors and classroom assistants during the school day and then assist in various after-school and community programs. The last week of Interim is spent back on campus discussing the experience. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Open to first-year students. Offered during Interim. Counts toward race and ethnic studies and American studies majors and race and ethnic studies concentration."
