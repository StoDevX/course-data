		"WRITING LIFE IN THE ANTHROPOCENE. Nobel Prize-winning scientist Paul Crutzen once proposed that we could now call our present moment in geologic history the “Anthropocene”— the time of pervasive human power shaping life on Earth. Reflecting on this era, a number of contemporary writers and environmental philosophers wrestle with devastating environmental realities from human-caused global warming to mass extinctions to contemporary use of technology. They attempt to write the intricacies of earthen tragedy, beauty and responsibility in the human age. This seminar explores writing that takes on that task of thinking about the Anthropocene. Each reflects on the porous and shifting borders of what counts as “human” and “nonhuman,” “natural” and “unnatural.” We’ll read Elizabeth Kolbert’s chronicle of species loss in The Sixth Extinction, Alison Hawthorne Deming’s personal essay-meditations on various species in Zoologies, and a range of fiction writers and poets such as Todd Davis, Ross Gay, and Pattiann Rogers as they attempt to write about life and death on Earth in new and provoking ways."
