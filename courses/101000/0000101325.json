	"desc": "THE BIBLE AND THE IDEA OF NATURE. In this section we are studying whether the Bible has anything to say about the modern politics of environmentalism. Some argue the Bible offers timeless spiritual lessons unrelated to specific political concerns like environmentalism. But others argue the Bible testifies to God\u0092s loving care for creation, and consequently lays down a religious obligation for modern people to protect the environment. What does the Bible say about the natural world? Using the imagery of gardens and wilderness as a way of thinking about the natural world, we are trying to determine what Biblical authors thought about nature. And we are trying to understand how modern people employ the Bible in arguments about the environment.",
