		"BORDER-CROSSINGS. 2015-16 marks the year of the greatest refugee crisis in recorded history. Using readings from journalism, nonfiction, and fiction, this seminar examines the concept of crossing borders-- geographically as well as metaphorically. Why leave home, why breach a boundary, how do people retain their humanity while crossing and creating a new life on the other side? Issues we explore include “border syndrome” as an emotional state (Gazmend Kapllani, A Border Crossing Handbook), undocumented immigration to the United States (Sonia Nazario, Enrique’s Journey ), cross-class identity in pre- and post-revolution China (Yua Hua, To Live), the body’s borders and the limits of medicine (the NY Times journalist who reported on the Ebola crisis), and the thin line between life and death (Markus Zusak, The Book Thief ). We focus on the process of writing and on contextual research in short assignments, with each student’s work culminating in a “dense” description of one border crossing."
