	"desc": "SEEING RACE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. In the past several years, the nation\u0092s attention has repeatedly turned to race and its role in contemporary life. Yet, in the public protests and debates that have followed events such as the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, activists, scholars, political leaders, journalists, and\u0097not least of all\u0097college students have pointed to the shortcomings of the contemporary dialogue about race. This seminar is intended to address this need. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the role of race in aspects of twenty-first-century American life including education, housing, jobs, and the law; examine its presence on contemporary college campuses; and trace its appearance in popular culture. Readings and other materials for this distinctly interdisciplinary course will be drawn from the social sciences, the arts, and the humanities.",
