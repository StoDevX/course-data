	"desc": "WOMEN AND/IN THE BIBLE. We will study the Bible and the way in which women are portrayed in and have responded to it. You will know your way around the Bible by the time we are through, knowing when, why, where, how and from which perspective biblical texts were written. You will strive for biblical literacy. We will know the classic \u0093proof texts\u0094 for and against women. In addition, we will look at the use of these selections in religious traditions to shape attitudes toward and treatment of women, focusing especially on women in different social locations; as harlots and manipulators; as victims of violence through rape, torture, silencing, marginalizing, and exclusion; and as active religious leaders as mothers, queens, judges, and ministers.",
