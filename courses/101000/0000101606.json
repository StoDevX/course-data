		"This course explores the intersection of science, scientific knowledge, and contemporary social problems. Through sustained inquiry into a specific issue or topic, it shows students the strengths and potential overlap of different research methods and perspectives from the social and natural sciences. Depending on the topic, students may also investigate the impact of the legal and political context on such work, and the complexities of representing research to the larger public. Offered periodically. May be repeated if topic is different. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing; a limited number of sophomores will be allowed to enroll"
