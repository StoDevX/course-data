		"IS THE BIBLE IMMORAL? Some atheists and agnostics say, yes, it is, but, interestingly enough, so do some Christians. The reason given is that the Bible seems to commend or depict without obvious criticism actions, policies and attitudes that many would regard today as immoral (e.g., genocide, child sacrifice, slavery, holy war, gender discrimination, heterosexism, ethnocentrism, anti-Semitism, masochism, destructive self-denial, or harmfully restrictive views of marriage, divorce and sexuality). But how can the Bible be “immoral” if, as the Christian tradition insists, scripture is supposed to serve as a source of moral wisdom (e.g., with the Ten Commandments or Jesus’ command to love the neighbor or the Sermon on the Mount)? In this section we address (among other things) the Bible as moral problem."
