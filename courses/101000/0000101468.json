		"Ecology focuses on the study of the interrelationships that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms. This core course examines organism-environment interactions and the study of populations, communities and ecosystems. Consideration is given to use of ecological studies in ecosystem management. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered each semester. Counts as \"ecology\" core category. Counts toward environmental studies major (all emphases) and concentration and mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisites: BIO 150 or BIO 126."
