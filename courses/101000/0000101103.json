		"This program provides an opportunity for students to gain direct teaching experience by serving as an intern/paraprofessional for a teacher in a Minneapolis/St. Paul public school. The Interim will heighten students' sensitivities to the complexities of multicultural, urban education and provide exposure to models used to foster educational and personal success in diverse student populations. On/off-campus orientation will be followed by four weeks of full-time work in a classroom with a host teacher and participation in weekly seminars with the college instructor. Reading assignments, journals, and guest speakers will complement the experience. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Apply through Education Department by Oct.15. Offered during Interim. Counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration and American studies major. Prerequisites: EDUC 260 and EDUC 290 or EDUC 330 or permission of instructor."
