	"desc": "LANGUAGE MATTERS. Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it \u0093the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people\u0092s minds.\u0094 Language\u0097spoken, signed, and written\u0097is one of the most important ways we influence others and construct ourselves. This seminar is ideal for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its changes over time and space, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we will address include: How does gender impact our language? How has the English language changed in the last 450 years? Why are \u0093bad words\u0094 bad? How do advertisers manipulate language? What does txtng do 2 yr language? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama show us how some authors have thought through these questions. We discuss these authors\u0092 ideas and the \u0093moves\u0094 they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience and the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of multiple drafts.",
