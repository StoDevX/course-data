	"description": "This course provides a sequential introduction to physical chemistry. Beginning with an introduction to statistical aspects of chemical equilibria, it explores the relationships between energy, entropy and equilibria (thermodynamics); oxidation-reduction reactions and electrochemistry; transitions between phases; and rates of reactions. Students attend three classes and one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisite: CHEM 125, or CHEM 121 and CHEM 123 and MATH 119 or MATH 120 or permission of instructor.",
