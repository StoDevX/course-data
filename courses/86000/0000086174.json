	"description": "In a democratic state, the media play an important role in linking the people to elected officials and political institutions. The course is principally concerned with this connection. By analyzing broad and varied forms of political communication and studying scholarship on the role of media in society, students explore the structure of American media with respect to political institutions, the effects media can have on individuals' political attitudes, and the role the media plays in political campaigns and governance. Prerequisite: None, but one course in political science is recommended. Offered alternature years during Interim.",
