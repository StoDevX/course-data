		"Since the 19th century, immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Islands have formed communities whose writing has expressed their shifting role as Asian Americans in the culture and economy of the United States. This course provides a multi-genre overview of Asian-American literary traditions in socio-historical context and with attention to current concerns such as diasporic displacement, gender, intergenerational conflicts, sexuality, transnationalism, and U.S. militarism. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years."
