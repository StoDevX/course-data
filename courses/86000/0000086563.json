		"This course provides an introduction to the study of folklore and presents a spectrum of approaches to the interpretation of fairy tales. Students read and discuss writings stemming from oral traditions such as the Nibelungenlied, and chapbooks including Till Eulenspiegel, and Faust; eighteenth century fables created on models from antiquity; fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm; and Kunstm√§rchen (literary fairy tales by known writers). Students explore the literary aspects of the works and their historical contexts."
