	"description": [
		"Two themes persist in early British literature: the role of fate (Old English wyrd) versus free will and the powers of wonders--from the miraculous to the magical. These themes are traced in the Old English period in sermons, charms and riddles, biblical epics and Christian texts, and the heroic epic Beowulf. Readings from the Middle English period include lyric and ballad, romance from the Arthurian and non-Arthurian traditions, drama, allegory, mystical treatises and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alternate years."
