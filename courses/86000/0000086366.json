		"This course examines the historical and cultural context of public education in the United States and the role that race, class, and gender have played in framing the experience we call \"public education.\" Students explore the multicultural imperative that emerged from the school reform movements of the 1980's and 1990's. The initial work of James A. Banks and his five dimensions of multicultural education (content integration, the knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, an equity pedagogy, and an empowering school culture and social structure) serve as the conceptual model for the course. Essential questions for the course include: To what extent has this movement transformed public school curricula and pedagogical practices? In what ways have multicultural education and critical pedagogy successfully addressed issues of inequity in public education? In society? What might a new model for the 21st century look like?"
