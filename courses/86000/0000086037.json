		"Second-semester music majors continue formal musicianship studies. Students perform rhythms and melodies at sight. Students also analyze and compose Western tonal music that employs non-dominant seventh chords, applied chords, sequences, modulations, and small forms. These topics are closely integrated into melodic and harmonic dictations. Pre-requisite: Music 112. Co-requisite: Music 162, Piano Class 2 (or placement into a higher level of keyboard proficiency). Offered annually in the spring semester."
