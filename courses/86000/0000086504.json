		"Student teaching provides the best possible introduction to the teaching experience. Student teachers practice all classroom teaching skills required to assure competency to begin their first year of teaching. Students are assigned to a full-time internship in schools under the guidance of a competent cooperating teacher and supervised by faculty from both the content area department and the Education Department. Includes orientation sessions, full-time teaching, and required seminars. Only student teachers can enroll: seniors or college graduates seeking dual licensure. Offered each semester."
