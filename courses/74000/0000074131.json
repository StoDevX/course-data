		"Students examine the geopolitics and political economy of Russia as an energy producing and consuming \"Petrostate.\" Beginning with the domestic political economy of the Russian energy industries, students proceed to Russia's relations with Central Asia from which it imports gas and with Europe to which it exports oil and gas. The course also considers Russia's relationships with the U.S.A., India, and China. There is also special attention on Russian/Norwegian energy relations in the Barents Sea. Prerequisite: Political Science 220 or 282. Offered annually."
