		"This course explores the fundamental principles of design, color, and composition through watercolor. Through advanced techniques, strong drawing, and exploration of personal ideas, students develop a personal, expressive, and visual language. Students are encouraged to move past trite and predictable solutions to seek alternatives, take initiative, and celebrate creative risk-taking. Prerequisite: Art 102 or Art 111 and 112 (or 110), and 113. Materials fee. Offered annually."
