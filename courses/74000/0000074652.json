		"Immigration policy and welfare reform exemplify how society's values and needs translate into policies and programs. Social workers work for justice by creating, implementing, and evaluating policies in health, employment, housing, and child welfare. Students study policy formation and analysis that reflect interests and powers of diverse groups as well as economic and social needs of certain populations at risk. The course emphasizes policy impact on women, people in poverty, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians, and Latinos. Open to non-majors by permission of instructor. Offered annually in the spring semester."
