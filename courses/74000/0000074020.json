		"Students trace and integrate the African-American and Euro-American dance traditions of the late 19th and 20th centuries and early 21st century, paying attention to their similarities and differences. The focus is on the theatrical dance genres of ballet, modern, and jazz (includes tap and some musical theatre dance). Students also examine social dance as the predecessor of some theatrical dance genres. At the same time, the course attends to the economic, religious, political, and social forces that have affected the development of dance in the United States. Extensive video examples supplement reading, live dance viewing, physical exploration, class lecture, writing, and discussion. Prerequisite: Dance 100 Introduction to Dance. Ticket/transportation fee required. Offered annually in the spring semester."
