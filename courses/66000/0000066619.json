Students explore the double meaning of \"sojourner\" throughout the course: first, as it applies to their own month-long experience, and second, with regard to local informants who lived elsewhere previously. Students develop projects and follow a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct \"Asian\" culture and society today.",
