		"Students pursue guided fieldwork experience in the United States. Activities and readings in this course build on the topics from AS 210 and three semesters of language study. Students explore the double meaning of \"sojourner\" throughout the course: first, as it applies to their own month-long experience, and second, with regard to local informants who lived elsewhere previously. Students develop projects and follow a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct \"Asian\" culture and society today."
