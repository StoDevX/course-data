		"This course explores the historical relation of religion and science, including issues like those raised by Copernicus, Darwin, and post-classical physics. Students compare the nature and grounds of religious and scientific claims, religious issues arising out of new technologies, new cosmologies, and the new biology, theology's response to modern science, and the role of religion in the relation of science and society."
