		"This seminar explores how the sciences have changed our perception and construction of the world - and humans within the world - and how theatre and theatrical performance both engage in and challenge those perceptions and constructions. Students examine how plays, performance, and the sciences interact and emerge in Western culture; how theatres, and a critical engagement with text and performance, participate in the methodology of science; and how \"science\" is performed on stage."
