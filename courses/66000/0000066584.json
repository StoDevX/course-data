		"392 A Psych of Women This seminar will focus on a limited number of issues affecting women, which we will explore in greater depth. Issues such as the following will be addressed: women's health issues (what are the differences between men and women? what health issues particularly or exclusively affect women? are there different responses to similar conditions? to similar treatments? what are the causes? are there any commonalities?); women's mental health issues (depression, addictions, anxiety-related disorders); women, hormones, pheremones and the like, gender differences in the brain; women and violence (domestic abuse, child physical and sexual abuse, effect of early abuse); women and poverty; cross-cultural issues and women and therapy. Students will be expected to take an active role in the seminar, which will include a research project on a topic relevant to the issues under discussion.",
		"392 B Development in Diverse Families How does development unfold within a variety of diverse family structures and contexts? Given demographic changes have made \"traditional\" middle-class, Euro-American, caregiver-mother-breadwinner-father, married, two-parent families increasingly unrepresentative of the population, we will explore parenting and child development across a variety of alternative family structures and sociocultural contexts, including primary caregiving fathers, divorced and remarried parents, and gay and lesbian parents. We will discuss similarities and variability across families and cultures, and unique challenges that \"nontraditional\" families may confront. Students will read and discuss scientific journal articles and book chapters, and bridge empirical research with popular culture and media portrayals of families. Prerequisite: Psychology 241. (Psychology 231 is recommended.)"
