		"This course provides a sequential introduction to physical chemistry. Beginning with an introduction to statistical aspects of chemical equilibria, it explores the relationships between energy, entropy and equilibria (thermodynamics); oxidation-reduction reactions and electrochemistry; transitions between phases; and rates of reactions. Students attend three classes and one 3-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Chemistry 125, or 121 and 123 and Mathematics 120 or 121 or permission of instructor. Offered Spring Semester."
