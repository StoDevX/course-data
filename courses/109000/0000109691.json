Students learn to read landscapes to discover how artistically, religiously, and ecologically important the landscape tradition has been in the United States and to become thoughtful viewers and creators of landscapes. Counts toward majors: art, American studies, art history, and environmental studies. Counts toward concentrations: American studies and environmental studies. Offered annually.",
