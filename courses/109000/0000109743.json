		"With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many psychological (schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders), neurological (Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Diseases) and health-related (eating disorders) disorders. In this discussion-based course, students use published basic and applied neuroscience research findings to examine the connections between the signs and symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230, plus PSYCH 238 or NEURO 239, or permission of instructor."
