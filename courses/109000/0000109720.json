		"This course examines historically significant conceptions of reality and knowledge focusing on philosophy's contributions to Western culture. Major philosophers from ancient, medieval, and modern Western philosophy are introduced and assessed for their contributions to our understanding of the universe, human nature, and values. Some sections offer a survey of Western philosophy; others stress intensive study of central figures and works. Consult departmental prospectus for details. Open to first-year students and sophomores only. Offered each semester."
