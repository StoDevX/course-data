It encompasses many possible identities--such as Latino, Hispanic, and Mexican-American--while remaining politically and culturally distinct in its intended meaning.

Students read works by 3-4 major Chicano/a authors. Offered periodically. Counts toward Latin American studies major and concentration and race and ethnic studies major and concentration.
