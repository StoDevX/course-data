The course covers automata theory including regular languages and context-free languages, computability theory, complexity theory including classes P and NP, and cryptographic algorithms. Offered alternate years. Counts toward neuroscience and linguistic studies concentrations. Prerequisite: a proof writing course (such as MATH 244 or MATH 252) or permission of instructor.",
