		"In this course we take a close look at the work of three writers who address the social challenges facing the United States during the turbulent interwar years. The dramatic consequences of the Great Depression only tell part of the story. America was also deeply affected by the aftershock of World War I, the rise of communism (and later fascism) in Europe, class struggles at home, women’s liberation, the great migration, urbanization, and modernization, which included revolutionary changes in both transportation and communication (modern journalism, the feature film and public radio broadcasting). In studying Steinbeck, Dos Passos and Agee, we will not only look at how the subject materials of their writings reflect these social changes, but also how the authors developed different -- and in some cases strikingly modern -- textual strategies to engage with this tumultuous era of American history. In addition to Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat, The Grapes of Wrath, and Cannery Row, Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy (The 42nd Parallel, 1919 and The Big Money) and Agee’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, students will read a variety of scholarly texts that situate these primary works in their aesthetic, cultural, social and historical context. Prerequisite: FYW."
