		"Students study computational problems arising from the need to store, access, transform, and utilize DNA-related data. Topics from computer science include: exhaustive search; algorithms (including dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, graph and greedy algorithms) for fragment reassembly, sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees; combinatorial pattern matching; clustering and trees; and hidden Markov models. Offered alternate years. Counts toward neuroscience, biomolecular studies, and mathematical biology concentrations and mathematics major. Prerequisites: CSCI 253, or one of CSCI 121 or CSCI 125, and one of BIO 125 or MATH 220, or permission of instructor."
