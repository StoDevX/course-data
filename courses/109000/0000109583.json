		"Winter is the defining season for many organisms in Minnesota, leading to specialized adaptations to survive winter's challenges. This course will focus on those adaptations that allow plants and animals to thrive in our climate. Coursework will include selected readings from the primary literature, field research, and opportunities to learn about the natural history of local plants and animals in the field. Prerequisites: BIO 150 and BIO 261, preferred. If you have not had BIO 261, please consult with the department chair (kandl@stolaf.edu) or the instructor (putnam3@stolaf.edu)."
