		"This seminar will examine in depth the historical and theological dimensions of the death of Jesus. We will look closely at the passion narratives of the Gospels and pre-Pauline hymns and creeds in order to discern the historical circumstances of Jesus’ death, the origins and earliest forms of belief in its salvific character, and how each Gospel writer develops a distinct theological interpretation of the passion. The centrality of the cross for Paul’s theology will also receive significant attention, and we will survey the interpretations of the crucifixion in Hebrews and Revelation. A secondary focus will be on how the New Testament provides the basis for major models of the atonement in subsequent Christian tradition, and the ways in which some recent theologians have criticized traditional atonement theories. The biblical and theological work will be augmented wherever possible by representations of Jesus’ death in art, music, and film."
