		"In this seminar we’ll read novels about families. The novel as a form — with its narrative ability to move in and out of interior states, to create numerous plots and sub-plots – has been particularly suitable for capturing the near-dizzying relations of family members. To help us make better sense of the complex relations between characters and the worlds they inhabit, we’ll dig deep into family systems theory and psychoanalytic theory. Texts for the course will be drawn from recent decades of American literature; novelists may include Jhumpa Lahiri, Richard Russo, Anne Tyler, Jonathan Franzen, and Dorothy Allison."
