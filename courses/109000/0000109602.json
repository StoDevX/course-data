	"description": "The course explores how people view Africa and the contested discourse on the meaning of \"Africa\" with special emphasis on sub-Sarahan Africa. Through lectures, discussion, and analysis of primary sources, students examine Africa's past in terms of material and social change; how the ordinary and the privileged made their world; economic and religious revolutions; responses to colonial encroachment and rule; and independence. No prior study of Africa necessary. Offered annually. Counts toward Africa and the Americas concentration.",
