		"Memorializing the Past. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" George Santayana's famous line about the importance of historical awareness suggests that “the past\u0094 can be readily recalled instead of carelessly forgotten. But since recollection \u0097 whether through memory or historical accounts \u0097 is a social act in which people interpret and negotiate the meaning of events, remembering is more challenging than Santayana implies. This seminar focuses on the tensions that emerge when we try to capture the past by memorializing it. What are the benefits of relying on inscriptions and objects to stimulate memory, and what are the drawbacks? Why was opposition to the Disney Company’s proposed historical theme park so fierce that it abandoned the project? Is the national Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. \u0097 a site that is more controversial than you think \u0097 well justified? We’ll explore responses to these and other questions as a way to improve our writing about the past. Readings include selections from Plato, Pierra Nora, Philip Gourevitch, Michael Eisner, Alison Landsberg, Elie Wiesel, and Roger Rosenblatt"
