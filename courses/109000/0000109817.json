	"description": "Students will learn and practice the skills and techniques involved in completing a triathlon. Triathlon training is designed to introduce fitness oriented swimming, cycling and running as a means of acquiring cardio respiratory endurance, muscle strength, and proper weight and body maintenance. Along with training, class sessions will include race strategy discussion, transitioning techniques, training plan formation, event planning, and an in-class or community triathlon event. Before enrolling, students should be able to swim at least 100 yards, cycle for at least 3 miles, and run at least 1 mile without stopping to rest. Students must provide their own equipment, including a bicycle. Offered annually in the spring semester.",
