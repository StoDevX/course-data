		"Despite the dominance of visual investigation of the social world, serious attempts to make sense of visual techniques of photography and filmmaking are surprisingly rare, and rigorous attempts to represent the social world visually are rarer still. This course seeks to fill these gaps by challenging students to grapple with visual theory and to develop their own visual research projects. In-class discussions of fieldwork, key writings about visual techniques by sociologists and anthropologists, and samples of groundbreaking documentary projects will inform student work."
