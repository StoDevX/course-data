They also engage in spirited discussion of Homer's influence on Vergil and of Vergil's influence on the literature, art, and music of Western civilization. Offered alternate years in the spring semester. Counts toward ancient studies and medieval studies majors. Prerequisite: LATIN 231 or equivalent.",
