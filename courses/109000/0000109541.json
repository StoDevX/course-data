		"This natural science course explores contemporary changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through the lense of paleoecology. Paleoecology is literally the study of past ecology, using proxy records (charcoal, pollen, nutrients) to understand the development of existing modern ecosystems as well as on-going and future changes in response to climate change, invasive species, and the intensification of agriculture. These changes are in part the basis for proposing a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Students learn about the sediment coring and other \u0093natural\u0094 archives, isotopic dating, and proxy-based reconstruction of ecosystem properties. The course will be taught using readings from the primary literature and will provide hands-on opportunities to learn more about paleoecology."
