		"This seminar has two major objectives: 1) to study the Holocaust within the context of twentieth-century European and German history, and 2) to examine key issues and problems historians encounter as they try to understand the Holocaust. Topics may include: antisemitism in Europe and the Third Reich; the genesis of the Final Solution; the bureaucracy, process, and personnel of extermination; individual and state complicity in the Holocaust; acts of resistance and rescue; evolution of the intentionalist/stucturalist debate; issues in the representation and memorialization of the Holocaust; the Holocaust and genocide studies; and the phenomenon of Holocaust denial. Students will read a variety of secondary works that place the Holocaust in historical context and identify important scholarly debates. Students will examine a range of primary sources (e.g., survivors’ testimony, photographs, official documents) to explore issues raised in interpreting certain types of Holocaust evidence. Finally, students will view a number of films, including Shoah, Schindler’s List, and Life is Beautiful, to consider how the Holocaust can be portrayed to a broad public in an historically and politically responsible way. Pre-requisite: Hist 191, 224, 226, or permission of the instructor."
