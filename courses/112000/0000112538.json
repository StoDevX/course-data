		"This course helps students explore the connections between society and their own lives. Students answer challenging questions such as \"Do we have a 'human nature'?,\" \"Why does social inequality exist?,\" \"What is race?,\" and \"How do societies change?\" In answering these questions students learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing so they review the various research methods and theories that form the sociological tradition. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs. Open to all students when taught during the summer. Offered each semester. Counts toward American studies major."
