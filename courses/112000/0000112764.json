	"description": [
		"This course examines (mostly) American literary and cinematic representations of war through books and films that engage with four historical conflicts: World War I (1914-1918), World War II (1939-1945), the Vietnam War (1961-1975), and the Iraq War (2003-2011). In addition to studying the conventions, patterns, and practices that inform the literary and visual treatments of these conflicts, students will explore historical and theoretical concerns that address the handling of violence and trauma, links between the combat film and war photography, filmic realism and authenticity, and Hollywoodâ€™s conceptualization of war and counter-narratives that challenge it."
