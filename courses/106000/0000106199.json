		"This course explores the everydayness of psychopathology in American culture. Exploring various approaches, but emphasizing a psychoanalytic-Marxist methodology, we will analyze how pathology gets normalized in culture and how such pathologization obstructs or corrupts collective attempts at social justice. Stated differently, we will study how such pathologies arrest the development of social progress. Areas to be explored include madness, criminality, and politics. Texts and films/television series to be analyzed include Dexter, Batman, The Talented Mr. Ripley, True Detective (season one), and American Psycho. Prerequisite: FYW. See English Department website for more details."

The genre studied may be broad, such as narrative fiction, or narrowly defined, such as the elegy. The course focuses on the study of literature through a critical exploration of form. May be repeated if topic is different. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term. Prerequisite: FYW.",
