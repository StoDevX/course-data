		"Students study the structure, bonding, and reactions of compounds containing metal-carbon bonds. Special topics include applications of organometallic chemistry to the synthesis of organic compounds, homogeneous catalysis, and biochemistry. Examples illustrate organometallic chemistry as a bridge between organic and inorganic chemistry. Students use bibliographic and electronic searching software to prepare research papers based on the current literature. Offered during Interim. Prerequisite: CHEM 247."
