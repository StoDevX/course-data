		"This lecture course surveys how art (mostly painting and sculpture) in Europe unfolded in remarkable ways relative to values signaled by the French Revolution. The course examines Neo-Classical art as it expresses Enlightenment thinking, the tumultuous Romantic and Realist imagery and times, and ends with Impressionism. Offered periodically during Interim. Open to first-year students."
