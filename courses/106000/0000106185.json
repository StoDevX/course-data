Students also analyze and compose Western tonal music employing the rubrics of rhythm and meter, pitch, intervals, scales, tertian chords, inversions, harmonic progression, and SATB voice leading. Offered annually in the fall semester. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in MUSIC 161 (or placement into a higher level of keyboard proficiency)."
