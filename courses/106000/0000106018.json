		"This course introduces students to computer science (CS), a field devoted to creative problem solving with computers, and its applications to other disciplines. Students explore fundamental concepts, including iteration, recursion, object-oriented software design, algorithm efficiency, levels of naming, parallel computing, and computing ethics. Students apply these concepts daily in hands-on homework exercises relevant to fields in the arts, humanities (including digital humanities computations), social sciences, and natural sciences. Includes a team project applying CS to a chosen discipline. No prior experience with programming is expected or required. Offered each semester. One of CSCI 121, CSCI 125, or CSCI 251 counts toward linguistic studies concentration."
