		"Student teaching provides the best possible introduction to the teaching experience. Student teachers practice all classroom teaching skills required to assure competency to begin their first-year of teaching. Students are assigned to a full-time internship in schools under the guidance of a competent cooperating teacher and supervised by faculty from both the content area department and the Education Department. Includes orientation sessions, full-time teaching, and required seminars. Only student teachers can enroll: seniors or college graduates seeking dual licensure. Offered each semester."
