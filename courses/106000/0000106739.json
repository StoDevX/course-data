		"This program provides an opportunity for students to gain direct teaching experience by serving as an intern/paraprofessional for a teacher in a Minneapolis/St. Paul public school.

Reading assignments, journals, and guest speakers will complement the experience. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Apply through Education Department by Oct.15. Offered during Interim. Counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration and American studies major. Prerequisites: EDUC 330 or permission of instructor."
