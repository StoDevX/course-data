		"American politics is about ideas. This course traces the origins of these and other important ruling ideas in the writings of America's most prominent thinkers. We devote special attention to what is often called \"the American creed\" (liberal individualism, egalitarianism, republicanism, and community) and the creed's many critics, particularly with respect to race and American political thought. Offered alternate years during spring semester."
