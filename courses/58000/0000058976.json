	"description": "How do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning process? While some emphasis is on analysis of the behavioral viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students also examine approaches to how we learn which have grown out of recent cognitive and ecological (evolutionary) perspectives in psychology. The course includes lecture and laboratory work with nonhuman animals. Prerequisite: Psychology 125, or Biology 125. Offered each year.",
