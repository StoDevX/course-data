		"This course studies 8 to 10 Japanese films by well-known directors such as Ozu, Kurosawa and Itami. Consideration is taken of the way in which their angle of vision affects the development of themes, such as the conflict between duty and feeling, the sense of family, or satire of the family. Includes both historical samurai films and contemporary social problem films. Offered during Interim in alternate years."
