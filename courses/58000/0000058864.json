	"description": "Students study modern Irish literature in four distinct Irish settings (ancient city, coastal village, urban capital, lake-country town) where this literature was written. James Joyce's Dubliners put Dublin on the map; Irish men and women, some of whom students meet on the trip, continue to write engagingly about modern life in a variety of locales. Readings, discussion, and cultural experiences (including theater, museums, and excursions by van) provide the basis for daily journal entries and several short papers. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. Offered during Interim.",
