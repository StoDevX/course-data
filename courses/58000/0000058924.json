	"description": "This course addresses computational problems arising from the need to store, access, transform, and utilize DNA-related data. Topics from computer science central to the development of problem- solving tools include: exhaustive search; algorithms (including dynamic programming, divide-and- conquer, graph and greedy algorithms); combinatorial pattern matching; clustering and trees; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites: Computer Science 253, or Computer Science 251 and Biology 125, or equivalent computer science and biology study, or permission of instructor.",
