		"Students examine fictional works such as short stories, novel excerpts, and other narrative texts, including film, with weekly writing assignments on plot analysis, characterization and multiple layers of voices in a text. Students retell stories in oral and written form and adapt them to different audiences. Coursework includes a review of basic grammar as well as advanced grammar for writing papers in German, with help sessions by native German exchange students. The course is designed to teach students writing strategies and the final project is a short term paper written in German. Taught in German. Prerequisite: German 232 or equivalent."
