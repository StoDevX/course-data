		"Emphasizing individual concepts, personal expression and strong composition, this course explores relief and lithography. Using large-scale, multicolor moveable block, collograph, wood or lino block techniques and lithography stones or aluminum plates in both black and white and color, students produce multiple images on one of the department's three presses. Students become familiar with the heritage of old masters as well as contemporary artists in printmaking. Prerequisites: Art 111 and 112 (or 110). Materials fee. Offered annually."
