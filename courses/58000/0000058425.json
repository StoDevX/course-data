		"This capstone course in the studio arts program consists of advanced studio work, a visiting artist series, weekly critiques, and discussions with faculty and peers. Each student's independent work with a faculty adviser culminates in a senior exhibition at Flaten Art Museum. Weekly sessions also cover such topics as preparing a resume, taking slides of one's work, framing and producing exhibition announcements and posters."
