		"These courses treat specific periods in American literature and examine the relationship between literary texts and movements and their particular cultural, political, and historical contexts. Each offering of this course examines a different literary era and emphasizes specific literary and historical issues. Students may register for the course more than once provided a different era is studied. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Early American Literature focuses upon the literature of the colonial and early national periods, as in works by Bradstreet, Edwards, Franklin, Wheatley, and Equiano, in the context of America's Puritan origins, democratic revolutions, and uneasy relations with native peoples. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19th-Century American Literature examines literary works by authors such as Whitman, Dickinson, Twain, James, Douglass, and Wharton in the context of emergence of modern individualism, industrialism and immigration, and the struggles for the rights of women and African Americans. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modern American Literature examines literary movements and works in 20th-century America, such as those by Frost, Eliot, Cather, Faulkner, Hurston, Ginsberg, Plath, and Morrison, in such contexts as the world wars, economic depression and experiences, and alienation of different cultures and generations. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
