Special emphasis is placed on appropriate repertoire for beginning and intermediate students. Pedagogy, discussion of well-known string performers (past and present), and the basics of studio management are accentuated through required readings, videos, discussion, and actual teaching experiences. Prerequisite: Music 214, 241, and 242 or permission of instructor. Offered Fall Semester, 2007-08, and alternate years."
