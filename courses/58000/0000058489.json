		"Building on principles learned in 113, students develop a harmonic vocabulary through analysis of seventh chords, secondary functions and common chord modulation. Studies in melody explore species counterpoint and develop through melodic reduction and phrase structure. Binary and ternary forms are also studied. Prerequisites: Music 111 and 113. Registration for 114 requires concurrent registration in Music 162 unless a student has either passed the Piano II equivalency examination or placed out of Music 162. Offered Spring Semester."
