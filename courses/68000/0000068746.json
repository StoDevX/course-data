		"In this course, students study the contemporary American family as it meets the challenge of a changing social world. The primary objective is to enlarge both personal and intellectual understanding of the complex issues facing families. Students study family dynamics and literature on different family roles (mothering, fathering, grandparents, siblings). Using the range of behavioral sciences concerned with family life, students study the interaction of individuals within families and of families within society. Offered Spring Semester."
