		"Students competing in intercollegiate athletics may use the season of participation in a varsity sport for 0.25 course credit in physical education. Only one 0.25 course can be applied toward the two 0.25 course Physical Activity (PHA) graduation requirement. In addition, an intercollegiate physical education (0.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose of earning a credit toward the 35 full course credits requirement for graduation. It can only be used once as one-half of the two-course PHA requirement. Fall: varsity football, soccer, cross-country, women's volleyball. Spring Semester: remainder of intercollegiate sports. Participants in club sports are not eligible. Students must register for the course during the competitive season."
