		"We will be based on the Adriatic Coast of Slovenia and travel to Italy, Croatia and Bosnia to study processes of political identity formation in a part of Europe which has seen the collapse of multi-ethnic empires and the multi-ethnic state of Yugoslavia. Students will be in groups representing the concepts used by Charles Tilly to analyze political identity. In group reports, students will construct analytical images of political identities in Piran, Triest, Vukovar, Sarajevo and Mostar."
