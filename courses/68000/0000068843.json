		"Fourth-semester music majors continue the aural study of chromatic harmony and melody, and 20th-century rhythmic idioms introduced in 211. Students also work on basic improvisation skills in a variety of musical styles: realizing chord symbols and figured bass, generating melodies from harmonic patterns and observing given parameters, and creating ornamentation and cadenza material for existing compositions. Prerequisites: Music 211/213. Co-requisite: Music 214. Offered annually in the Spring Semester."
