		"This course focuses on biological and physical features of arctic ecosystems, their responses to climate change, and consequences of climate change for ecological processes. The foundation of the course is the discussion of current literature on arctic ecosystems. The course briefly reviews causes of climate change in the Arctic, and focuses on biogeochemical cycles, biological communities and the unique characteristics of organisms, as well as the impacts of climate change on human societies. Students attend lecture plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 125 and 126 or Environmental Studies 137; and any 200-level Biology or Environmental Studies natural science course. Offered annually."
