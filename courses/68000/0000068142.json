		"This interdisciplinary seminar uses basic concepts of environmental science to explore global environmental issues. Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and participants will recognize many of the seminar issues from coverage in the media. Because most environmental problems involve issues beyond the science, the seminar examines the economic, political and ethical dimensions of environmental questions and environmental decision-making. Offered each semester."
