		"Students learn to design and conduct qualitative research in the tradition of sociological and anthropological ethnography.

Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward management studies concentration. Prerequisite: SOAN 291 or SOAN 292. Open to junior or senior sociology/anthropology majors only."
