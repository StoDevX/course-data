		"This course explores the science of microbiology and the impact of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and prions) on human affairs and daily life. Topics include microbial diversity, cell structure and function, growth and metabolism, genetics, control of microbial growth, host-pathogen interactions, immunology, infectious disease, and applied microbiology. Each topic provides a basis for discussion of current issues where microorganisms play a role. Students attend lectures plus one two-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually. Also counts toward public health studies concentration."
