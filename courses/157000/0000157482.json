		"Students examine the influence of race, class, and multiculturalism in American schools by participating as teachers' assistants and tutors in Honolulu schools. Students discover the challenges and benefits associated with teaching in a diverse racial, cultural, and socio-economic environment. Through guest lectures, readings, field trips, and seminars, students learn about the truly unique geographic and cultural setting of the Hawaiian Islands. This environment makes an excellent framework for examining race, ethnicity, power, and privilege in U.S. schools. Fulfills EDUC 382: Human Relations requirement. P/N only. Intended for education major/licensure students; cannot fulfill the January Term requirement for TEFL certification. Offered alternate January Terms, even years. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Prerequisite: EDUC 295 or EDUC 330."
