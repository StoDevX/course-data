They experience rhythmic pattern as an organizing principle for the human body, an expressive capacity, and a social connector. Students investigate the cultural and social milieu from which dance genres emerge. Dance genres could include, hip hop, West African, Asian, and Caribbean dance forms, tap dance, or jazz dance. May be repeated. P/N only. Offered each semester."
