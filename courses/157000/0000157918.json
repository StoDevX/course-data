		"This course explores the inner workings of the publishing world from literary magazines to book publishers. Students explore the modern history and trends of publishing in America, as well as engage with hands-on projects that both illuminate readings and offer insight into the daily practices of writers and literary gatekeepers. Projects may include the drafting of a proposal for a hypothetical literary magazine, reading submissions for a magazine, and conducting a podcast interview. Offered annually. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
