		"The ability to reproduce is one of the key features of a living organism. Studying the biology of reproduction requires a synthesis of information and concepts from a wide range of fields within biology. This course addresses reproduction at the genetic, organismal, and population levels. Laboratory work adds a valuable investigative component to the course, and social/psychological issues are addressed throughout. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category. Also counts toward gender and sexuality studies major and concentration if approved by petition.
