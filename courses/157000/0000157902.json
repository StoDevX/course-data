		"Markets are guided not only by economic goals but also by moral values of freedom, fairness, justice, and ideals of the good life itself. Through readings in economics and philosophy, this course explores the relationship between moral and economic values in the marketplace from the ancient world up to the present. Characteristic topics include the status of wealth in a virtuous life, fair trade, economic freedom, pricelessness, and the tension between public and private values. Offered annually. Also counts toward business and management studies concentration."
