		"Through immersive, multifaceted engagement with Korea including but not limited to the performing arts, guest lectures from writers and cultural bearers, and visits to significant cultural and historical sites, this course ponders the production of a Korean indigeneity in critical contexts. Students consider how indigenous practices recognized as \"intangible cultural heritage\" construct national identities, and how these traditions are deployed to reimagine and write Korean selves. Counts toward the Race and Ethnic Studies major/concentration."
