		"This course on Søren Kierkegaard--which takes place in his hometown, Copenhagen, Denmark--moves through some unusual thematic territory. We examine the dialectic of meaninglessness and faith, boredom and passion, solitude and silence; we ask about the joy and pain of embodiment; and we explore forms of love and commitment. Discussions take place in the Danish classroom, but also on-site in the parks, squares, churches, castles, and surrounding forests mentioned in his works."
