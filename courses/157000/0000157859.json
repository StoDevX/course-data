		"After mastering the foundations of data science - especially data wrangling and visualization - in MSCS 164, data science students are ready to explore impactful applications and deeper fundamentals. Programming fundamentals may include iteration, functions, conditions, data types, SQL, regular expressions, version control, and simulation - all in the context of real data. New applications may include text as data, geospatial mapping, networks, and web scraping to produce dynamic graphics - presented with attention to data ethics and reproducible research. Offered annually. Counts toward statistics and data science concentration. Prerequisite: MSCS 164: Data Science 1."
