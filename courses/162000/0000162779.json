		"Approaching the world as a \"global village,\" the course will focus on the development of the world as an interdependent entity, the relationship between the \"developed\" and \"developing\" world, alternative explanations for planned social change, and new institutions for this international world. Global challenges such as the information revolution, population, the status of women, and migration are analyzed to illustrate this interdependence. Offered annually in the fall or spring semester. Also counts toward international relations and business and management studies concentrations."
