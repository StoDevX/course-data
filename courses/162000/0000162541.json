		"\"Global Flows\" engages students in academic and public discourses that emphasize inclusivity, cross-cultural understanding, and global citizenship. We will examine the movement of objects, ideas, and people across history and within and outside of Asia, helping students develop a historical foundation for their future study of Asia. As a first-year seminar, students will also focus on building community as well as skills for succeeding at college. This is the first course in a four-course Conversation Program."
