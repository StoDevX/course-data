		"Recent United States Poet Laureate, Joy Harjo, asserted her voice as the first \"Indigenous poet\" to occupy the role, and she is reflective of the increasing presence of Indigenous voices in mainstream American culture and politics. Drawing on history, literature, and cinema, this course explores the tension between dominant American culture's representations of Native America and Indigenous cultural productions and self-representation. It begins with Philip Deloria's history, Playing Indian, which argues early colonists took on ‘Indian’ identities to reinvent themselves as Americans, and concludes with the first all-Indigenous television series, Reservation Dogs."
