		"For over a thousand years, women in East Asia have profoundly influenced the development of the visual arts, yet their significant contributions often remain overlooked. This course will explore the vital roles women have played as patrons, artists, and collectors in China, Korea, and Japan from the 10th century to the present. We will examine a wide range of artistic practices, including painting, sculpture, photography, propaganda, and performance. In addition to studying their artistic contributions, we will critically analyze the roles and experiences of women throughout history, focusing on the intersections of gender, sexuality, and power in East Asia. While the course draws from Asia, it is not limited by geographic boundaries. Several featured artists come from East Asian diasporic communities, offering a global perspective. The course will also highlight how the cultural understanding of \"woman\" as a social category, and gender as a social construct, has shaped ideologies and experiences related to family, labor, ethnicity, and the body."
