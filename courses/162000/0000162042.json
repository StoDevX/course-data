		"This course examines environmental issues foregrounded by questions of social justice, exploring how to combine concern for the natural world with attention to inequality and power. How do intersecting oppressions contribute to environmental crises? How do people and communities negotiate with the unequal impacts of environmental degradation? We will experiment with interdisciplinary approaches to unpack the possibilities of \"environmental justice\" and to engage in research and activism that is radically accountable to the environment and to other people."
