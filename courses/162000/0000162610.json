		"Meditative practice lies at the heart of the Buddhist tradition. Students explore the theories and practices of meditation in the Buddhist traditions historically developed and practiced in India, China, Korea, and Japan. Through this course, students develop an in-depth understanding of the Buddha's teachings in association with the principles behind those meditative practices, the modern adaptations of these practices, as well as the relationship with the Buddhist teachings on well-being and spiritual happiness. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward the Asian studies major and concentration."
