		"A rich array of diasporic literature is set amongst the Pacific waves, tracing not only life journeys between homelands and islands, but also racial and ethnic tensions compounded by nuclear weapons and wastes. This course introduces novels, poems, plays, and memoirs that tell Asian, Oceanic, and Austronesian experiences of displacement. Students explore how literary writing carves out spaces for and lends voices to diasporic communities in the Pacific world. Offered alternate years in spring semester. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
