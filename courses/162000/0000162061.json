		"A serious engagement with ancient political texts remains indispensable both as a contrast with our modern self-understanding and as a surprising continuity with questions we continue to ask. Students read and discuss prominent ancient political thinkers from a range of ancient cultures, such as Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Mencius, Al-Farabi, and Augustine. Offered alternate years during spring semester."
