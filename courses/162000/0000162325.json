		"Primarily for non-music majors, this course presents the fundamental materials of music and exposes students to the development of styles, ideals, practices, and technologies that provide context for listening with understanding. Through a study of landmark works from the 17th to the 20th century, students develop and practice listening techniques that sharpen critical perception and open the door to a fuller enjoyment of all styles of music. The ability to read musical scores is helpful but not required. Offered annually. Does not count toward B.A. music major or any B.M. music major."
