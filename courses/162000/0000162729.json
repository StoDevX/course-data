		"Students explore how family relationships are influenced by social, historical, and political contexts. Drawing on a range of disciplinary contexts and research, this course underscores the ways family relationships are constructed, sustained and challenged in society, with emphasis on theories and practice of family communication. Students draw on the relational dynamics studied in the introductory family studies course to transition to elaborating on the complexities of family functioning in U.S. society and beyond. Offered each semester."
