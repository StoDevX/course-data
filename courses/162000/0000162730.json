		"Students explore the topic of family and gender roles in Spanish society by analyzing cultural documents (literary and non-literary texts, including at least one substantive literary work). This cultural analysis provides for the development of critical reading and writing skills (e.g., description, narration, exposition, and argumentation). Taught in Spanish. Offered each semester. Also counts toward gender and sexuality studies and Latin American studies majors and family studies and gender and sexuality studies concentrations. This course is equivalent to SPAN 251 and students can earn credit from only one of them. Prerequisite: SPAN 232 or placement into SPAN 250 or SPAN 251."
