		"This 0.25 credit course supports students involved in community-engaged experiences. It is not for students who are enrolled in an Academic Civic Engagement (ACE) course which already carries the Ole Experience in Practice (OEP) attribute. Students explore readings, videos, and first-hand experiences about fundamental concepts of ethical engagement, including identity, reciprocity, communication, and solidarity. Students reflect on their experiences engaging with different communities as it relates to their academic learning, vocational goals, and the common good. Prerequisite: Concurrent registration in a non-OEP ACE course, working in the community-based work study program, or with instructor permission."
