		"This survey of cognition examines how we acquire (perception, attention, learning), store (memory), communicate (language) and use knowledge (thinking, judgment, problem solving, decision making, creativity). Such issues influence how we educate people, evaluate eyewitnesses in court, convince consumers to buy products, and improve our memory or attention. Students will engage in hands-on activities as a part of the class to enhance our study of the mind. Offered annually. Also counts toward applied linguistics and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125."
