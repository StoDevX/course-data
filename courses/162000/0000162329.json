	"description": [
		"The Bible has been a catalyst for social transformation and a cudgel for repression, intersecting with racism, gender performance, sexuality, climate change, and religious violence. This course explores historical, literary, and ideological approaches to biblical interpretation, focused on how its messages and interpretations shape and are shaped by the worlds they inhabit. Sustained attention is given to readings of the Bible from historically marginalized communities (including Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Ecofeminist, Queer, and Jewish perspectives)."
