		"Students explore modern German history from the Enlightenment through the establishment of a modern German nation-state (1871), two World Wars and their aftermath, up to the late Cold War period when the question of how to frame Germany's modern history became a matter of public debate. By examining primary sources in English translation, critical historiography, and ethical perspectives, students learn not just the major turns in modern German history, but consider the ethical implications of revolutionary and revolutionizing movements and the ethics of history-writing itself. Students hone skills of interpretation and argumentation in writing and speaking. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Counts toward German major, History major, German Studies concentration, International Relations concentration."
