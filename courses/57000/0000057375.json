		"In many respects, products like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and opium provide the glue that holds together modern life. This course examines the web of these substances from an anthropological perspective. Our focus includes the politics of production, the culturally diverse practices of consumption, and the social consequences of regulation. Based on our collective experience at St. Olaf, we consider the mood-altering substances on and off campus and examine their influence in such things as our social identity, individual consciousness and the structure of authority. Offered during Interim."
