		"This course explores video as a creative medium. Students learn basic video production and editing techniques, producing a number of individual and group projects. During the semester we examine a wide variety of videos and films, exploring experimental, documentary, and narrative approaches. The class also considers the history of video art and its relationship to other time-based and static art forms. Prerequisites: Art 117 and one other two-dimensional foundation course: Art 111, 112, 113 (or 110), or permission of instructor. Materials fee. Offered annually."
