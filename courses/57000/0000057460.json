		"The goal of this course is to introduce students to the long tradition of debate concerning the nature and legitimacy of war. The course explores the reality of war, the revulsion of violence and the possibility of just war through texts ranging from Thucydides, Aquinas, and Freud. The course explores contemporary debates in light of moral and empirical arguments learned."
