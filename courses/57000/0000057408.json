		"Literature provides rich resources for thinking through central philosophical questions, including the metaphysics and ethics of freedom, the problem of evil, the role of character in choice and action, the nature of morality, rebellion and human solidarity, God's existence and relation to the world, and the nature of truth. Designed primarily for first-year students, this course explores philosophical ideas in literary works of several different genres by studying plot, character, point of view, imagery, and symbolism. Offered during Interim."
