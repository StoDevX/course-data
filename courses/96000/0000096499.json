		"This course takes a case-study approach to the fitting and assessment of statistical models with application to real data. Specific topics include multiple regression, model diagnostics, and logistic regression. The approach focuses on problem-solving tools, interpretation, mathematical models underlying analysis methods, and written statistical reports. Offered each semester. Counts toward mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisite: STAT 110, STAT 212, or STAT 214, or ECON 263, or equivalent preparation, or permission of instructor."
