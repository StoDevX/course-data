		"EnvSt 281 Sustainable Development (SOCSCI) â€“ Seth Binder The past 200 years have seen unprecedented, exponential improvements in the health and material well -being of humankind. Yet, a substantial portion of the world's 7 billion people is largely excluded from this progress. Many of the same forces that have created this extraordinary material growth and concomitant inequality have also contributed to the vast and rapid alteration our natural environment. The unintended negative consequences of environmental change threaten to rob current and future populations of the benefits of continued economic development. This has led to a call for \"sustainable development.\" In this course, we will discuss the ethical and historical underpinnings of the sustainable development concept; explore what exactly is required for development to be susta inable (especially with respect to the environment); investigate the factors that have led development to be particularly unsustainable; and evaluate a variety of steps -- both incremental and radical -- that can put us on a path to more sustainable development."
