		"This course emphasizes skills necessary to understand and analyze economic data. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability and random variables, sampling theory, estimation and hypothesis testing, and practical and theoretical understanding of simple and multiple regression analysis. Applications to economic and business problems use real data, realistic applications, and econometric/statistical software. Offered each semester. STAT110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics. ECON 263 is recommended for economics majors who do not plan to take both STAT 272 and ECON 385. Credit will not be given for more than one of STAT 110, STAT 212, or ECON 263; credit will not be given for STAT110, STAT 212, or ECON 263 following completion of STAT 272. Prerequisite: MATH 119 or MATH 120 and one of Economics 110-121, or consent of the instructor."
