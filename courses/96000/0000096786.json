	"description": "EnvSt 281 Soil to Plate (ARTHUM) \u0096 Mark Allister In this course students study food and the local foods movement from soil to plate. Study takes place in and out of the classroom: students read the agricultural bill and Michael Pollan; watch documentaries about our national food issues and visit local farms; work with and on local farms to see how they do their business; and, as often as possible, cook and eat. Fine chefs welcome. Those who aren't will get some cooking lessons.",
