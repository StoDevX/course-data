Study takes place in and out of the classroom: students read the agricultural bill and Michael Pollan; watch documentaries about our national food issues and visit local farms; work with and on local farms to see how they do their business; and, as often as possible, cook and eat. Fine chefs welcome. Those who aren't will get some cooking lessons.",
