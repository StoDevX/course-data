	"desc": "Developments in the field of computing now allow undergraduates to create effective and innovative applications of powerful computing techniques in any target discipline. This seminar brings computer science (CS) students together with students in target (non-CS) disciplines to create interdisciplinary software applications involving modern high-performance computing that are useful for research and/or teaching in those disciplines. Current projects are in linguistics, environmental science, psychology, mathematics, finance, and robotics. Students should contact the instructor (rab@stolaf.edu) before registering for this seminar.",
