		"This core course explores major principles of cellular and molecular biology and it or the Chemistry/Biology 125-127 series is a prerequisite for all level II biology courses. Emphases include the structural and chemical composition of cells, crucial metabolic pathways, fundamentals of cell division, basic genetics, and the scientific method. Materials integrate concepts with problem-solving. Students are introduced to state-of-the-art library search technologies and scientific writing. Students attend lectures plus one 2.5-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the fall semester and during interim."
