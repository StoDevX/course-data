Topics from computer science include: exhaustive search; algorithms (including dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, graph and greedy algorithms) for fragment reassembly, sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees; combinatorial pattern matching; clustering and trees; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites: Computer Science 253, or Computer Science 121 and Biology 125, or Computer Science 121 and Mathematics 220, or permission of instructor. Offered alternate years. Counts toward neuroscience concentration.",
