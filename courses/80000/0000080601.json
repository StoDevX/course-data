		"Learn to use methods of 21st-century neuroscience to study current questions about mind-body relationships. Psychophysiology, an area of cognitive neuroscience, reveals new insights about cognition and emotions by measuring accompanying changes in physiological activity such as brain waves, heart activity, and facial muscle movements. Students work in teams to gain hands-on laboratory experience and training in principles and techniques of electro-encephalography, electro-cardiology, and electromyography. Prerequisite: Psychology 125. Offered during Interim. Counts toward biomedical studies and neuroscience concentrations."
