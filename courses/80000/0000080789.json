		"Through nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, students explore the complex relations between humans and the \"natural\" world. Students consider questions such as: What does it mean to have connected to a landscape? What is a sense of place? Students also reflect about how they and the writers they read put landscape and experiences into language. Prerequisite: FYW. Counts towards American studies major. Counts toward environmental studies major (all tracks) and concentration."
