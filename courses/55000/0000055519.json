		"This course explores the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people from several social science perspectives. Students examine debates about whether gender and sexual orientation (both heterosexual and homosexual) are socially constructed or biologically natural, and what cross-cultural and historical examples can reveal. The course also addresses controversies surrounding the family, religion and politics in regard to GLBT people, along with examining movements for change."
