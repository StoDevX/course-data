		"The sagas, myths, and poetry of the Vikings rank with the world's great literary treasures. Strong men and clever women engage in a heroic struggle with a tough and unyielding nature and face perennial human problems: love and hate, crime and punishment, travel and adventure. These works will be read in their historical and cultural context, as well as examining their impact on popular culture, including film, video games, comics, and sci-fi/fantasy fiction."
