		"The course examines how basic conventions, styles, and forms of music convey drama, emotion, and meaning in dance, opera, musical, and film genres. Intended for the general student (non-music major), the course provides fundamental musical listening skills and vocabulary to analyze and describe how music can partner with movement, texts, and visual images to portray time, place, and plot, while simultaneously depicting a character's mental state, conveying political messages or predicting the future."
