		"Is the press free to shape a nation's politics? How do news media shape international relations? Through the assigned readings, students explore the answers to these questions in the context of East Asian countries ( including China, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan). Additionally, each student will conduct an up-to-date investigation of how news media, such as newspapers, television, and the Internet, contribute to national images within Asia."
