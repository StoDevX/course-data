		"\"Courtly love\" evokes images of knights and ladies vowing eternal devotion in elegant language. The development of courtly love in the early 12th century, and its consequences for people then and now, provide this seminar's focus. Using literature and historical scholarship, students explore the ideal of courtly love, its social function, its role in literature, the arts, and music, its relationship to Christianity and to the feudal system. Emphasis is on intersections between literature and intellectual and social history: How well do literary sources reflect actual social practice? How does literary practice shape experience to create works of art? Offered periodically."
