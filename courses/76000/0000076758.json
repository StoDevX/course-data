		"Primarily for non-music majors, this course presents the fundamental materials of music and exposes students to the development of styles, ideals, practices, and technologies that provide context for listening with understanding. Through a study of landmark works from the 17th to the 20th century, students develop and practice listening techniques that sharpen critical perception and open the door to a fuller enjoyment of the musical arts. The ability to read musical scores is helpful but not required. Activity fee. Offered during interim 2011."
