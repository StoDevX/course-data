		"In this course students read, analyze, and write their own works of speculative fiction (e.g., fantasy, science fiction, magical realism, fabulism, slipstream, etc.). Students read and discuss short stories and novels for half of Interim, paying attention to form, themes, and content. They then spend the other half applying their knowledge to these genres by crafting and workshopping their own stories through peer revision. Offered annually during Interim. Prerequisite: FYW."
