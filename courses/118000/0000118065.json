		"Students spend one evening each week exploring topics at the interface of mathematics and biology. Faculty introduce topics supported by a reading assignment to be done prior to class. Class time is spent exploring the problem and developing the mathematical approach to solving it. Topics may include invasive species, sex-ratio evolution, neural networks, feedback control, graph theory, statistical ecology, and population genetics. P/N only. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisite: STAT 110, MATH 120, or equivalent."
