Class periods may focus on the historic development of forensic science, proper collection and storage of evidence, background in scientific concepts, scientific techniques used to analyze evidence, the types of information that can be obtained, and the statistical methods for making a case in a court of law. Some topics that may be covered include hair, drug, paint, fiber, fingerprint, accelerant, or DNA analysis. The laboratory component features the use of forensic techniques to collect and analyze evidence including fingerprinting, drug analysis, alcohol investigation, DNA fingerprinting, and fiber analysis.
