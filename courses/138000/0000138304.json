		"Students learn how gender is perceived, constructed, and experienced in contemporary Norway, using psychological and sociocultural perspectives to explore topics such as family life, youth development/empowerment, education, employment, media/advertising, health, and sexuality. They also examine indigenous SÃ¡mi and immigrant perspectives. Lectures, site visits, and other field experiences augment scholarly readings and contribute to an understanding of gender equality as a foundational guiding principle and practice in an increasingly diverse Norwegian society. Offered alternate years during interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Also counts toward Norwegian and women's and gender studies majors and Nordic studies and women's and gender studies concentrations. Prerequisites: PSYCH 125 or a course in Nordic Studies, Women's and Gender Studies, Family Studies, or Sociology/Anthropology, or permission of instructor; PSYCH 241 or PSYCH 249 strongly recommended."
