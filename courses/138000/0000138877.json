		"This course examines the development of the crime fiction genre in English, from its emergence in the 19th century to the present day, giving particular attention to form, meaning, and historical context. Students read pioneering works by Poe, classic detective stories as formulated by Doyle and Christie in England, Amercan \"hard-boiled\" crime writers like Hammett and Chandler, police procedurals from both sides of the Atlantic, and examples of the sub-genre spy fiction. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW."
