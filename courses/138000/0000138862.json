		"How do we ensure complex structures don't fail? How can we model air flow around a wind turbine? How does heat get distributed as a rocket reenters the atmosphere? To solve real-world problems, computational tools are essential in the engineer's toolbox. Students will learn and apply numerical methods for interpolation, differentiation, integration, and solving ordinary and partial differential equations. After grasping these fundamentals, students will use finite element simulation software to model increasingly complex systems. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward physics major. Prerequisites: PHYS 130, PHYS 131 (or PHYS 124, PHYS 125, and CSCI 121/CSCI 125), MATH 226, MATH 230."
