		"A study of the Arthurian legend, from its Celtic origins through the classic medieval romances of Chretien and Malory, to Victorian adaptations of Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites, to contemporary novels and film. Analysis focuses on the myth’s characteristic forms and ideas; the errant knight’s adventures, the grail quest, triangulating desire, and adulterous love."
