		"Students examine the diverse elements that have shaped the cultures of U.S. Hispanics and Latinx through an exploration of political, social, economic, religious, and artistic topics. They develop critical analysis through reading, discussion, and written and/or oral projects. Students examine processes of identity and inclusion, and its connections to historical narratives. Students analyze materials through an intersectional lens of race, colorism, language, generational differences, class, gender, and sexuality. May be repeated if topic is different. Taught in Spanish. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: SPAN 250 or SPAN 251."
