		"This course addresses how religion - beliefs, practices, values, the ways it functions in society - is reflected in contemporary film. Religion addresses fundamental questions of human existence: Why are we here? How should we live? Why is there suffering and evil? What happens when we die? The course alternates between close readings of central religious texts which probe such questions (including the Jewish Scriptures, the New Testament, and later theologians and philosophers) and films that take up the questions, as well. While the central focus is on Christian and Jewish sources, the course also considers non-theistic perspectives. Through analysis and discussion of both text and film, students begin to form their own answers."
