		"Engineering Thermodynamics explores the relationship between energy, heat, and work. Students develop the analytical skills to model the movement of energy through a system. Major topics include the laws of thermodynamics, heat transfer processes, control volume analysis, engine cycles, gas and vapor power systems, and refrigeration and heat pump systems. These thermodynamic processes are fundamental to a wide variety of engineering fields. Offered annually. Prerequisites: PHYS 130 and PHYS 131, or PHYS 124, PHYS 125, and CSCI 121 or CSCI 125; and MATH 126."
