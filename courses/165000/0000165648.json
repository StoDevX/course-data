		"Students interrogate the systems and experiences of sex and sexuality and its intersection with empires from the eighteenth century to the twenty-first. By examining primary sources, engaging with secondary sources, and producing original research, students develop an understanding of sex practices and ideas about sex in the past and the systems of oppression and categorization that shaped relations between the colonized and colonizers. Offered alternate years in spring semester."
