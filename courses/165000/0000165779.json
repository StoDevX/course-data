		"Democracy is widely regarded as a triumph of liberal civilization. Yet democratic citizens are so often ignorant, irrational, and narrow-minded. Meanwhile, a new wave of populists, elitists, and autocrats are challenging democratic institutions and assumptions. This course explores the moral justifications for democracy in light of major objections and investigates whether there is something genuinely virtuous about the kind of society it sustains. Students discuss sources in philosophy and political science. Offered periodically."
