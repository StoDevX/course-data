		"Students learn about formal languages, automata, and other topics concerned with the theoretical basis and limitations of computation. The course covers automata theory including regular languages and context-free languages, computability theory, complexity theory including classes P and NP, and cryptographic algorithms. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: a proof writing course (such as MATH 234, MATH 244, or MATH 252) and computer science major or permission of instructor."
