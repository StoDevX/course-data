		"Formal education has always emphasized written texts even though human beings are surrounded by photo-generated images and visual culture. This course helps fill that gap and offers methods for understanding the social world visually. The course challenges students to grapple with visual theory and develop their own visual research projects. Discussions of fieldwork, key writings about visual methodologies, and samples of groundbreaking visual sociological projects will inform student work. Offered alternate years."
