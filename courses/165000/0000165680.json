		"In this course, students will explore the processes of sensation (how our sensory epithelia change physical information from the environment into electrical impulses in our brains) and perception (how we utilize those electrical impulses to form a representation of the world giving rise to our subjective realities). Students participate in in class psychophysical, physiological, and perceptual activities on vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste in order to enhance their learning. Offered annually. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125."
