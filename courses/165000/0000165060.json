		"This seminar explores a public-facing format for historical storytelling: podcasting. Students are trained in assessing podcasts as public history, then develop podcasting episode topics, conduct historical research, practice \"writing for the ear\", learn how to optimize sound recording and edit audio, and engage in peer review and iterative writing and audio editing processes. For the final project, students work together to produce a podcast of their own, from concept to final product."
