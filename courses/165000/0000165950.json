		"Individuals, communities, and organizations have found ways to address even the most egregious state abuses of human rights and other injustices. Using comparative analysis, this course considers cases and theories of nonviolent personal and political resistance and the factors that appear to contribute to people taking action and to successful responses. Students research and analyze cases of their choosing in light of the literature. Collectively students address an injustice, learning to research, network, strategize and take action over the course of the term. Prerequisites: PSCI 220 and at least one course in the subfield, or permission of instructor."
