	"description": [
		"This course explores the evolution of and the imagined possible worlds in Asian science fiction, which has proven to be a media-hopping genre, from the early 20th-century to the present. The quest thus will traverse short stories, novels, manga, anime, and films. Emphasis is placed on close readings of primary sources, the historical moments that prompt the texts' science fictional musings, and their cross-cultural appeals. All readings and viewings will be available in English translations. Offered alternate years."
