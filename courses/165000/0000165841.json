		"The Christian tradition is replete with images of heroes and villains, human and beyond, in soaring redemption arcs and precipitous falls from glory. Students critically engage material inside and alongside religious communities by examining biblical texts, theological writings, art, comic books, and film. This course explores Christian depictions of human capacities, divine nature, evil, salvation, and hope, ideals that continue to shape broader cultural values and life."
