		"In this course, students examine the rich intellectual history of the Russian Empire from its founding in 1721 to around 1850. In those years, no question was more urgent to Russian thinkers than the place of Russia in the world. Students explore the intellectual, spiritual, and historical currents that shaped this question through readings drawn from the debate between two opposing intellectual camps; the traditionalist Slavophiles and their reform-minded rivals, the Westernizers. Offered periodically during spring semester."
