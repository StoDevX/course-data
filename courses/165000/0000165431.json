		"Human health is affected by the biological environment, a teeming world of parasites and diseases, and the physical environment -- the water, air, and landscapes that we inhabit. Human interactions with the environment have changed rapidly, as human populations grow, travel increases, and ecosystems are altered. This course touches upon traditional environmental topics such as air and water quality and integrates newer public health challenges such as emerging diseases and food-borne illnesses. Offered periodically. Also counts toward business and management studies and public health studies concentrations. Prerequisite: an introductory science course."
