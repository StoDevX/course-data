		"Opera was conceived in Italy in the 16th century and has continued to evolve into the living artistic expression presented worldwide today. In this course, students explore and reflect on opera while being embedded in the unique cultural settings of two countries of its origin: Austria and Germany. Through readings, research, reflection, discussion, and group projects, students connect history, architecture, politics, society, and art to performances on the stage and the places that shaped them. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Open to all students."
