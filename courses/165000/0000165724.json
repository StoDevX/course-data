		"This course introduces students to the urban and rural landscapes of two Irelands - the Free State/Republic, and Northern Ireland - through histories of love and sex from 1884 to 2018. Students consider histories of marriage, prostitution, same-sex desire, and bodily autonomy, and how the built and imagined environment shaped possibilities, dangers, and everyday experiences of love and sex. The course culminates in original research projects utilizing the archives only accessible by visiting Ireland."
