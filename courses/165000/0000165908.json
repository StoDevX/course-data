	"description": [
		"Pope described Homer’s poetry as “a wild paradise”; Borges heard his verses “echoing forever in mankind’s hollow memory.” Students explore that poetic Eden and listen for echoes when they translate selections from one or both of Homer’s poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Through discussion and readings, students learn about the characteristics of ancient epic and investigate topics in Homeric scholarship. Students engage in at least one significant writing project, such as a literary translation. Offered alternate years in the spring semester. Prerequisite: GREEK 231 or equivalent."
