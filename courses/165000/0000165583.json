		"This course immerses students in the narrative, storytelling culture of Indigenous Australian and New Zealand peoples, the Aboriginal and Maori cultures. Students gain an understanding of the history of these peoples, their family culture, and storytelling as a healing and powerful force. Students study Narrative Family Therapy and learn to articulate the parallels between it and Aboriginal and Maori culture. Students also learn to apply this theory to their own lived experience.
