		"This interdisciplinary course explores principles and approaches in second language learning and teaching with the focus on Asian languages. Through debunking myths in second language learning, students will learn key factors affecting second language learning and effective language learning strategies. Skills in teaching a second language in Asian context are also discussed. However, this course focuses on the research and theoretical understanding of language acquisition rather than on pedagogical methods of language teaching. Offered periodically."
