		"Race Matters is an interdisciplinary learning community for first-year students that focuses on race, ethnicity, and related matters (such as gender, sexuality, class, and religion) in the twenty-first century with a general though not exclusive focus on the United States. The thoroughly integrated curriculum of these three courses bridges the humanities and the social sciences, offering students a deep and broad engagement with race and ethnicity in the contemporary world. This course is the third course in the three-course Race Matters Sequence. It is only open to Race Matters students. RAMAT 130 is offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: RAMAT 110 and SOAN 121."
