		"Students study the history, philosophies, and consequences of the largest nonviolent social change campaign in U.S. history. After several days in the Twin Cities, students embark on a two-week field study in the South, visiting historical sites and museums, and interviewing participants in the movement. Past stops have included Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. A final week of integrative seminars in the Twin Cities allows students to consider lessons from the freedom movement that shed light on current challenges to democracy within the United States."
