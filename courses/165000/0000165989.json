		"Students pursue guided fieldwork experience and language study in Japan. Activities and readings in this course build on the topics from ASCON 110 and ASCON 120 and language study. Students continue to explore their understanding of Asia through language activities, site visits, and ethnographic observations. Students complete language-based tasks and follow a process of inquiry that will help them understand how ordinary people construct \"Asian\" culture and society today. Offered periodically during January term. Priority will be given to ASCON students. Prerequisite: at least one semester of Japanese language study at St Olaf or equivalent."
