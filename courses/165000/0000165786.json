		"With recent advances in neuroscience, we can now describe the biological correlates of many psychological disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. In this discussion-based course, students use published research findings to examine the connections between the symptoms of these pathologies and changes in brain neurobiology, biochemistry, and physiology. Offered periodically. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230 and PSYCH 247, and PSYCH 238 or NEURO 239."
