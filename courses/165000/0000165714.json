		"Students investigate community-based approaches to environmental sustainability during this January Term course taught in Tokyo, smaller towns in the Kansai region, and at the Asian Rural Institute (ARI) in northern Japan. Students explore how ARI builds on local Japanese resources to support its mission of training rural leaders from developing countries in organic agricultural practices. Activities include field trips, discussions, and field outings, as well as hands-on participation in the daily food life at ARI. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Prerequisites: preference given to students with prior coursework in either Asian studies or environmental studies."
