	"description": [
		"Lord Tennyson called Vergil the \"wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.\" Students encounter that stately measure when they translate selections from Vergil's three major poems (Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid). Through discussion and readings, students also explore the development of Latin epic and Vergil's reception in later literature, art, and music. Depending on the instructor, students engage in at least one significant writing project, e.g., on poetic interpretation or literary translation. Offered alternate years in the spring semester. Prerequisite: LATIN 231 or equivalent."
