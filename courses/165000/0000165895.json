		"Students explore how instrumentation is used to study analytical applications, problem solving, and how people and instruments operate together to investigate chemical questions. Specific lab experiences include interfacing chemical instruments with computers and subsequent signal processing, mass spectrometry, electrochemistry, and various spectroscopic (AA, ICP, UV) and separation techniques. Students attend one four-hour laboratory per week. A laboratory robot is used for sample preparation and analysis. P/N only. Offered annually. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in CHEM 382."
