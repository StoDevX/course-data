		"Students study French language and Québec culture through an immersion experience that includes home stays with local French-speaking families in Québec City and Montreal. Second-year French grammar and writing and speaking skills are integrated into the reading and discussion of texts focusing on the experiences and identities of immigrants to Québec and their descendants, as well as how immigration is shaping the linguistic and cultural identity of the broader Québec population. Taught in French. Offered periodically during January term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Prerequisites: FREN 231, placement in FREN 232, or by permission of instructor."
