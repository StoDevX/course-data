		"While explicit racism is not tolerated, implicit language-related racism is usually invisible and pervasive. Why? This course examines the relationship between language, race, and power. Through exploring materials from different times (from the nineteenth century to contemporary), spaces (Japan and USA), and texts (language policies, popular media), students examine the role of language in constructing racial Other and how speakers \"negotiate\" race with language. Offered periodically. Also counts toward the Japanese and race and ethnic studies majors and the applied linguistics and race and ethnic studies concentrations."
