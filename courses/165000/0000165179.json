		"The death of God refers to the absence or non-existence of God in a post-Christian world. What happens after God has exited the scene? Is there only nature, humanity, or nothing at all? Students evaluate the challenges that the death of God has for thinking about God, the meaning and purpose of Jesus in such conditions, as well as religious belief, reason, and the secular by reading classical and contemporary theological work on the death of Jesus and the death of God. Offered periodically."
