		"Students investigate relationships between music, gender, and sexuality from a variety of analytical perspectives including musicology, anthropology, media studies, gender and sexuality studies, and queer theory. The course is structured around class discussions of a series of ethnographic studies that engage with questions of how people in different cultural contexts experience music, gender, and sexuality. Students study a variety of models for music research, which they use to guide their own ethnographic projects. Prerequisite: MUSIC 141 or permission of instructor."
