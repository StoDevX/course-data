		"This course examines the ethical commitments of Renaissance literature and asks students to use works by Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and others to reflect on their own ethical decision-making. The course is constructed around two main areas of ethical concern that connect today's world to prior centuries: the good life, and political ethics of leadership. This course asks how these texts' ethical commitments can help us understand enduring ethical dilemmas. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
