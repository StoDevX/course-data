		"This course explores the complex human interaction with drugs. The readings examine historical trajectories of substance use and the ways drugs shaped the development of societies. Students learn more about how drugs work biologically and socially, as well as reasons why drugs can create powerful forms of addiction that often resist treatment. Ethnographic evidence vividly depicts the layered intersection of drugs, addiction, and therapeutic intervention in the United States and elsewhere."
