		"This course explores the notion of sacred places and examines specific sites sacred to ancient people, Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Students visit both natural landscapes and constructed sites and attend to places' physical characteristics and history, ongoing human interaction, inter-religious dynamics, scholarly theory, and their own lived experiences of place. The interplay of religion, social life, and political power within sacred spaces provides additional thematic focus. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Also counts toward ancient studies major."
