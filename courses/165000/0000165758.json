		"This course examines the process of colonization in North America, emphasizing cultural encounters and the emergence of differential power relations between Indigenous, European, and African-descended peoples. It begins with an examination of Native American communities, and their creative responses to European colonization during two centuries of contact. It likewise explores the transatlantic slave trade, urban and plantation slavery, the emergence of African American culture that formed in response to these historical experiences, and other related topics."
