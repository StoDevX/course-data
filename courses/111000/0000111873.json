		"This course examines the ethical teachings of Jesus with close attention to their historical, literary, and theological contexts. It also sets Jesus' moral teachings in the context of the Western ethical tradition and brings them to bear on the task of contemporary ethical reflection and action. Issues examined may include non-violence, social and economic justice, sexuality, and racial and ethnic conflict. Although the course format, learning skill sets, and some of the contents are different from the regular REL 276 course, students are eligible to receive credit for only one of these courses. Offered spring semester 2016-17 and fall semester 2017-18. Prerequisite: BTS-T or permission of the instructor."
