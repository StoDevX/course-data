		"Dance, morality, and the bodies upon which they are displayed are subject to intense debate in America. What makes something a \u0093dirty\u0094 dance? How are such categories constructed, maintained, or contested through the human body in motion? This class uses the lens of dance to explore the ways in which cultural, religious, and political notions of normative morality, are shaped around bodies, gender, race and beauty. By examining the question of Western ethical construction from an embodied point of view, students are asked to consider alternative normative frameworks for critical and constructive ethical reasoning. Movement will specifically be used in the course as a mode of inquiry. No dance experience required. Dancers and non-dancers welcome."
