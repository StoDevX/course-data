		"TWITTERIZING THE LIBERAL ARTS: WRITING ABOUT AND WITH TECHNOLOGY. Americans spend nearly 11 hours per day on electronic media, according to some sources. It is almost impossible to escape digital technologies in our day-to-day lives, including in our academic work – and why would we want to? Digital technologies offer innovative possibilities for refashioning ourselves, creating communities, and producing academic knowledge in the twenty-first century; on the other hand, digital technologies might also prove harmful to meaningful pen-and-paper work that has been done in the liberal arts for centuries. This course will investigate our preconceptions of “new” technologies to continue developing a critical digital literacy for learning and working with technology in the liberal arts. Possible assignments include critical reflection about our experiences with technology, film review, critical literary review, persuasive essay, and researched multimedia project. This course does not require any technological knowledge, and readings will draw from the humanities, social sciences, and technological sciences."
