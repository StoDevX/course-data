		"This course studies the development of the twentieth-century British novel (including several novels written by authors writing from and about former British colonies). While the course focuses on literary innovationâ€”the aesthetics of modernist, postcolonial, and postmodernist fiction, students will also examine how novels from the past century engage with their historical context, or the social, cultural, and political circumstances out of which they arise. Students will consider how a diverse set of writers from the UK and its colonies have refined or challenged notions of citizenship and subjecthood within a global empire, as well as how the British novel models the contradictions of intercultural relation and difference. Authors studied include Conrad, Woolf, Beckett, Jean Rhys, Zadie Smith, and Moshin Hamid. Prerequisite: FYW. See the English Department website for more information."
