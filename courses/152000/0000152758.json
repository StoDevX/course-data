		"This 100-level seminar explores the nature of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements of the 20th century. Students will investigate the organizations, primary organizers, political figures, and competing theories that defined the era. Students will examine numerous primary source documents alongside secondary source historical accounts to construct arguments about the similarities, differences, and contradictions of the movements. At the end of the semester, students should be able to identify the contributions of several activists, organizations, and the movements to the broader Black Freedom Struggle and U.S. history."
