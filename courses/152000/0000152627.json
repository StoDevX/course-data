		"This course will introduce you to the popular and scholarly ways that we write about video games as well as the ways video games communicate with us through multimodal conventions and genre-specific language. You will investigate the motives (economic, cultural, and aesthetic) behind game development while analyzing how games function as rhetorical artifacts. Readings for this class are primarily academic to provide a broad view of scholarship on video games. However, you will also play games to help you to see how these theories translate into practice. Course work will include short assignments leading up to two digital, multimodal compositions with a strong written component."
