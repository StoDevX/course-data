		"How do we know what's ethical in a medical setting, and how can we explore those ethics through literature? Going a step further: how can reading and writing lead us to deeper insights about the nature of health itself, including the health of an individual, a group, or even a society? And how do processes of research and reflection inform the daily choices of readers, writers, and medical practitioners? As we explore a range of genres in this course, from memoir and drama to journalism and a documentary film, we'll ask how literature and medicine can interact to teach us about observing details, setting priorities, and listening in ethical ways. By working on three sequenced portfolio collections of writing during the semester, each student will first hone their own authorial voice, before learning to engage with one other writer on a key medical debate, and finally hosting a research conversation between multiple cited sources."
