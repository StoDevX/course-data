		"In this course students study deeply the nature of religion itself, experiences of divine union, detachment from false realities, altered states of consciousness, creative scriptural interpretations, gendered differences among reports, and mysticism's role in world peace or world strife. Students study the mystics themselves from a variety of religious and secularist traditions (variously Hindu, Jewish, Indigenous, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Ecological). Reading and experiencing mindfully, practicing bodily, students engage their whole selves. Offered annually in the fall semester. Prerequisites: Open to current first-year students under OLE Core; students under GE curriculum must have completed BTS-B."
