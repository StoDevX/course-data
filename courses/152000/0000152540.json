		"This course focuses on film, television, and other mediatized representations of Vikings and medieval Scandinavia. Depictions of the past greatly influence our interpretation and understanding of history, and also give insight into the present. Students will examine the origins of Viking myths, as well as historical debates. Topics include the Hollywoodization of a Nordic hero, depictions of gender, race, and sexuality, as well as the use of Nordic mythology in far right- wing circles. Offered annually. Also counts toward medieval studies major and Nordic studies concentration."
