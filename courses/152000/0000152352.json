		"This course explores the work of Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway is known for his involvement in big game hunting, deep sea fishing, world travel, bull fighting and boxing. His experiences inspired his writings, and students read several of his novels, short stories, poems, and articles. In addition to the above, the course examines the popular image of Hemingway and highlights two aspects that are not properly acknowledged: Hemingway as a global citizen and the role of Africa in his life and work."
