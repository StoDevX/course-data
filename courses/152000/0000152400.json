		"Why does it seem harder than ever to distinguish the truth from what we think we know, or misinformation from what we want to believe? This seminar explores the history of media and misinformation through the Cold War era, a period of conflict between geopolitical rivals, but also an ongoing contest of ideology, belief, propaganda, and rumor. We will explore critical moments when governments, the press, and the culture industry have leveraged media and misinformation to inform, deceive, divide, or shape public opinion. Students will develop as writers by analyzing evidence and creating argumentative \"op-eds\" that grapple with big ideas and engage various audiences in some of our society's most pressing problems. We will find that the histories of misinformation and the Cold War are deeply entwined and crucial for understanding our own relationship to media, politics, and each other."
