		"In this course, students explore Transatlantic Visual Culture, an emerging field of art historical scholarship that endeavors to accomplish these goals: 1) Study the movement of people, objects, and ideas as they have moved throughout Africa, the Americas, and Europe; 2) acknowledge this movement as rooted in systems of colonialism and slavery; 3) move toward methodologies that are transcultural and transnational; and 4) value a wide variety of visual materials as worthy of investigation, beyond what has been traditionally considered \"fine art.\""
