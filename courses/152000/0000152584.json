		"This course provides a broad overview of the cinema from its beginnings to the present day, while introducing students to historically informed methods and arguments that have contributed to the shape and continuing development of film studies as a formal discipline. In addition to adopting a global perspective to explore the cinema's role as a powerful aesthetic, social, and cultural force, students examine key movements, conventions, practices, and periods that inform film history. Offered annually in the spring semester."
