		"One foundation of a liberal arts education is learning to \"read\" or interpret one's own culture and the cultures of others. This seminar introduces students to the field of Cultural Studies through methods and techniques of interpreting cultural texts, from poems and popular songs to graphic novels, paintings, and films. Students will learn and practice multiple modes of textual and contextual analysis and consider relationships between cultural texts and identity, history, and ideology. This analysis will provide the basis for developing skills in a variety of types of college writing."
