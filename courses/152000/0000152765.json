		"This 200-level seminar examines the role of gender, race, and class in the development of policing in the United States. Branching from its beginnings in chattel slavery to the present, this course is an overview of the carceral state and the impact of the prison industrial complex on marginalized communities. In this course, students will utilize a variety of sources, including film, primary documents, art, and more, to construct theories about the nature of the carceral system and what communities can do to shift its harm. By the end of the semester, students should be able to identify key events in the making of the carceral state and argue how the systems of racism, capitalism, and patriarchy influence policing and incarceration in the United States."
