		"This course will examine historic minority populations and their encounters within the nation-building efforts of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. The course seeks to answer how the Nordic nation-states pursued the diaspora with an emphasis in what is considered the Nordic region today, and interactions with neighboring Russia up until World War II. With the historical political environment as our entry point, we will also examine social history--how communities lived and interacted, the beliefs and values they held, and how events in the world around them influenced their daily lives in both the short and long term."
