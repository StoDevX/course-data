		"This course explores a remarkable period of literary history: Russia's 19th century or the \"golden age\" of Russian literature. In rapid succession, Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov produced one masterpiece after another, dazzling Western audiences and shaping the modern mind. Beyond the arts, diverse fields - philosophy, theology, psychology, political science - have been influenced by the Russian classics. Topics include doubt, nihilism, despair, faith, God, death, and the meaning of life. Taught in English. Offered alternate years. Counts toward Russian area studies major; does not count toward Russian language major."
