		"Students examine the application of clinical psychology in the context of the U.S. legal system. Students use empirical articles, secondary sources, case studies, and legal sources (e.g., U.S. Supreme Court cases) to investigate how psychologists conduct evaluations of psycho-legal issues like competency to stand trial, insanity pleas, and civil commitment. Students discuss the ethical, legal, societal, and mental health benefits and consequences of how the U.S. legal system resolves issues pertaining to mental illness. Offered periodically. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230 and PSYCH 247."
