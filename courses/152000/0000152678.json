		"Are grocery stores located more frequently in certain areas than others? Is your health related to your zip code? How much will it snow in Northfield? Do bees of different species tend to live near each other or in separate areas? These seemingly different questions are united by a common thread: We address them using data collected over space. In this course, you will learn to visualize and analyze three main types of spatially correlated data through examples in a wide variety of applications. Pre-requisites: Introductory Statistics (Stat 110, Stat 172, Stat 212, Econ 260, or equivalent) AND experience with R (Stat 172, Stat 212, MSCS 164, MSCS 264, or other)."
