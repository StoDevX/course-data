		"What does a life well lived look like? The course examines how a variety of traditions answer this question, such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Utilitarianism, Nietzschean Individualism and Scientific Naturalism. Students explore how contemporary practitioners address issues such as work, race, sex, and the environment as dimensions of a life well lived. The class reflects on these competing visions and explores ways to navigate the conflicting ideals within today's global context. Offered periodically."
