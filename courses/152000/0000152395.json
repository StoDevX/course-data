		"Monarch butterflies, sea turtles, and wildebeest are some of nature's famous migrators, but humans migrate, too. Our own migrations take many different forms. These journeys can be geographical, chronological, over different time lengths, and taken individually or collectively. Migrations are also topically diverse; our opinions, identities, knowledge, relationships, priorities, and more may migrate over time. In this seminar, we will support each other in reading, discussing, and writing about a range of topics relevant to human migrations and their intersection with identities. Thought-provoking fiction and non-fiction readings will help us identify, reflect on, and write in various ways about our own migrations, as well as enrich our knowledge about different individuals' and groups' identities and journeys."
