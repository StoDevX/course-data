		"This survey course challenges students to break out of their European protective shields and \"imaginings\" and to think globally, while appreciating the contributions of other civilizations that have had such a telling impact on the modern world. Through a rigorous analysis of a list of primary sources and assigned reading, the course examines the significant political, religious, social and economic developments of humankind, and strives for the global perspective. Some historical processes, as one historian aptly stated, are best studied on a global, rather than a single perspective. Offered annually. Also counts toward international relations concentration."
