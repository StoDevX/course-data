		"Board games, card games, and video games express systems. When we play games, we explore how these systems work and what they might mean in our daily lives. In this class we will practice reading games and academic texts carefully, create games and write academic papers, and explore how to revise to improve both. In our final unit, we will closely examine struggles faced by students at St. Olaf in order to explore how games might even make our lives better. Ultimately, we will discover how games can teach us to write more effectively and how writing papers can help us create better games."
