		"Students examine the work of a major American author. Through attention of life experiences, cultural contexts, and the impact of history, the course offers students a complex understanding of a major author's literary achievement. Recent authors have included Melville, Cather, Wharton, Hemingway and Faulkner. Because such study is intensive and requires background, students should have prior exposure to the author studied. May be repeated if topic is different. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term. Counts toward American studies major. Prerequisites: ENGL 185 plus at least two English courses at level II, or permission of the instructor."
