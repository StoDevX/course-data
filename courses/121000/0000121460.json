		"Water is a beautifully simple molecule that is essential for survival (precious). Rivers have run dry, aquifers are overdrawn, pollution is widespread, and, with climate change, desert is encroaching and rains are hard to predict (precarious). In Morocco, like much of the world, safe drinking water, water for basic sanitation, or water for agriculture, is in short supply and sometimes not available at all (problematic). Students examine water from a scientific perspective -- chemical, physiological, ecological -- and delve into the historical, political, economic, and social implications in Morocco -- a country of diverse cultures and biotic zones from two oceans, mountain ranges, and the driest of dry deserts. Students learn through readings, lectures, student presentations, and field trips. This class is suitable for any student with sophomore standing. First-year students having completed Bio 150, or ES 137 may be considered. Counts toward biology major, environmental studies major (natural science elective), and Middle Eastern studies concentration"
