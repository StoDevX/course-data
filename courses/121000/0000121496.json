		"This course is a survey of African-American art, from folk and decorative arts of the 19th century, to Modernist painting and sculpture in the 20th, to the multi-media productions of today. Issues of race and identity are explored through examinations of the visual productions of African American artists. The course is discussion-based. Working in groups, students learn to closely examine artworks and related texts. Individual research and writing projects deepen students' engagement with the material. Offered periodically. Counts toward art history, studio art, American studies, and race and ethnic studies majors; and Africa and the Americas and race and ethnic studies concentrations. Prerequisite: none, but ART 153: Introduction to Art History strongly recommended."
