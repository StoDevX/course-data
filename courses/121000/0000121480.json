		"This seminar integrates the experience of work and the search for career in the context of Norway. Course content includes both an internship in Oslo and a reflection seminar. The reflection seminar connects academic theories/analyses of work and Norwegian culture with the internship experience. Through reading, writing, and discussion, this course provides a space in which to reflect on the challenges, hopes, and fears facing students embarking on their postgraduation careers. Counts toward Norwegian, history, environmental studies, political science, and exercise science majors; and educational studies, Nordic studies, and statistics concentrations. Offered alternate years during Interim. Prerequisite: completion of FOL in Norwegian."
