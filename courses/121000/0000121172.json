		"How do film, literature, and the law in France address the trauma of World War II and its aftermaths? What are the \"memory wars\" and how are they represented and negotiated? In this course, students read short theoretical texts on memory and trauma studies and think about how theories of memory and forgetting intersect on page and screen, as well as in policy and public opinion. Students will workshop, write, and revise a series of short papers. Taught in English. Offered periodically. May count toward the French major."
