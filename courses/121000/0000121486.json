		"Students examine migration into the United.States and the Netherlands. This includes an historical overview, but also a focus on migration in recent decades. Using readings, lectures, and site visits in Miami and Amsterdam, students learn and apply concepts and theories of migration. They compare and contrast migration causes and pathways; consequences of and responses to migration; and contemporary issues such as refugee crises, unauthorized migration, and anti-immigration movements. Offered periodically during Interim. Prerequisite: one course in Sociology/Anthropology or permission of the instructor."
