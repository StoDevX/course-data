		"This seminar-style course develops students' abilities to reflect on Americans' encounters with their landscape traditions. Students study ways Americans have built on the land and have worshipped and represented nature in paintings, photographs, and advertisements. Students learn to read landscapes to discover how artistically, religiously, and ecologically important the landscape tradition has been in the United States and to become thoughtful viewers and creators of landscapes. Counts toward majors: art, American studies, art history, and environmental studies. Counts toward concentrations: American studies and environmental studies. Offered annually."
