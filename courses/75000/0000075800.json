		"Students encounter German literature and develop skills and strategies for reading and interpreting literary texts in their historical and cultural contexts. In interpreting the texts, students practice writing and oral communication individually and in small groups. The specific topic may vary and may be broadly or narrowly defined to include a survey, genre, theme, period, or the literature of one German-speaking country. Taught in German. Prerequisite: German 251 or 252. Offered alternate years or periodically."
