The somatic disciplines of Body-Mind Centering, Bartenieff Fundamentals, Ideokinesis, and Experimental Anatomy provide the theoretical foundation of this course. It includes exploration of the \"attention-intention-action cycle\" as life practice. Prerequisites: Dance 201 and Dance 111 or Dance 115. Offered every other year."
