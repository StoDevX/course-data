		"This course examines Jewish religious and philosophical thought in Europe, the United States, and Israel. Social/cultural history and literature provide additional lenses on the modern Jewish experience. Important themes include emancipation, integration, and acculturation; the Enlightenment and its challenges to the authority of Jewish religious tradition; the changing role of religion in the emergent secular nation-state; and negotiations of minority/majority status in modern societies. Offered alternate years."
