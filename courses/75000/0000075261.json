		"Would you like to revisit the pleasures of bedtime stories, your first chapter book, and the adventures of characters you've grown to love (or hate)? This course combines the fun of children's literature-focusing on twentieth-century classics from the US and England-with a different sort of fun, the intellectual gratification of critical reading. How do books from Winnie-the-Pooh to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone imagine their child readers? How do these books appeal to the dual audience of the children who enjoy them and the adults who purchase them? What relationships can we trace between the fantastic world of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland or The Hobbit and the historical and cultural realities of their authors readers? What to picture books and chapter books have to say about race, gener, socioeconomic class, education, ethics, and politics? By reading children's literature carefully and in context, we will develop a greater appreciation of this genre's range, artistic accomplishments, and cutlural significance."
