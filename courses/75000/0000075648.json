		"This course provides a study of chemical stoichiometry and equilibrium at a level and pace appropriate to students with little or no background in chemistry. The combination of this course and Chemistry 123 (offered during interim) provides coverage of topics equivalent to those in Chemistry 125. Students planning to continue in chemistry should consider concurrent registration in Mathematics 120 or 121. Students attend three classes and one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the fall semester."
