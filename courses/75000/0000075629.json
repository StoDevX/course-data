		"Students in this seminar will use design process as a technique to creatively and efficiently tackle large projects in a group setting. We will focus on the construction of a working Rube Goldberg Machine, a whimsical and creative yet complicated and demanding task, using the design process. Students will examine formal techniques for identifying goals, brainstorming ideas, establishing timelines, prototyping ideas, and creating formal presentations. Hands-on skills will also be taught and utilized throughout the construction process. A background in science is not necessary; it is in fact one goal of this seminar to bring together science and non-science majors in creative collaboration."
