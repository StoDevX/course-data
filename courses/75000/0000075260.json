		"How do sexual experiences and impulses contribute to identity? How are sex and sexuality involved in representations of national identity and cultural difference? This course explores thse question as they play out in postcolonial contexts. Our novels' authors and settings span much of the former British Empire, touching on India, South Africa, Egypt, Antigua, Sri Lanka, the United States, Canada, Ireland and English itself. Alongside gripping novels including Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy, Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, and Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, we will also watch and discuss the films Bride and Prejudice, Monsoon Wedding, and My Beautiful Laundrette."
