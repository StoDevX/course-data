To answer these questions this course investigates security, economic, and cultural relations at the beginning of the 21st century within Asia and between Asia and Russia and the U.S. This course looks at the historical interaction of national, regional and global forces for additional answers. Prerequisite: previous course in Asian studies or political science, or permission of instructor."
