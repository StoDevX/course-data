		"This course explores health and culture in Oceania, examining sources of influence such as the colonial experience, regional and global interdependence, the impact of nuclear testing, and the co-existence of traditional and \"modern\" values. Students examine these cultures on Oahu Hawai'i, Kosrae, and Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), through ethnographic readings, guest lectures, field trips, and as participant observers at events. Offered in alternate years during interim."
