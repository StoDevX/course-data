		"Students gain a broad overview of the significance of gender with a special focus on the Nordic countries, recognized internationally as pioneers of gender equality. Systematic reflection on central quests of gender policy and theory help students to see, analyze, and problematize gender in texts, theories, and methods. A critical overview of gender equality in everyday life, education working life, politics, and ethnic relations illuminates specific social and cultural contexts in the different Nordic countries."
