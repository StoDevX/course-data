		"Environmental research is increasingly conducted by teams of researchers, and in this course students work in groups to research specific topics. Topics vary from year to year at the discretion of the instructor, and examples include impacts of green roofs on runoff, carbon sequestration, and biomass alternatives to fossil fuels. Depending on the topic, the course may include a laboratory. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 137 and additional course(s) as determined by instructor. Offered most years."
