		"This course explores research on parenting and child development across a variety of alternative family structures and sociocultural contexts, including families with primary caregiving fathers, divorced and remarried parents, and gay and lesbian parents. Students discuss similarities and variability in development across families, and unique challenges that \"nontraditional\" families may confront. Students examine and bridge the empirical literature with popular culture and media portrayals of families. Prerequisite: Psychology 241; Psychology 230 is recommended. Offered most years."
