		"Integrating the human body, the digital video camera, and the computer, students explore the creation and performance of movement as artistic expression. Students explore, practice and discuss basic artistic movement technique, improvisation and composition; video production and editing, and computer animation of the human form - all with an emphasis on dance for the camera. Reactive/interative technologies may be introduced and explored. Students produce a number of individual and group movement projects. Students perform, view, describe, and analyze class projects. Students view and discuss a variety of dances made for the camera. The class culminates with an evening public showing. No prerequisites or previous dance or computer experience required. Materials fee. Offered during interim in alternate years."
