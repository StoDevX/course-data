They study social and cultural notions inherent in the daily life of peoples in diverse Francophone communities and learn to think critically and make interdisciplinary connections and informed cross-cultural comparisons. Offered in the fall semester. Does not count toward French major. Open to students with no prior background in French, or placement."
