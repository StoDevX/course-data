	"description": [
		"In this interdisciplinary writing course, students respond to visual art, music, film/TV, and dance, not only writing about these art forms but also translating their formal qualities into writing (e.g., writing as riff, montage, or tango). By exploring literatureâ€™s relationship to the other arts and studying the work of artists and writers working across disciplines, students examine how artistic vision is shaped and gain a more capacious sense of the possibilities of language. Self-directed excursions, peer workshops, and in-class writing exercises spark new approaches to the creative process. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
