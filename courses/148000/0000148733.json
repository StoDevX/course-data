		"Currents of nationalism, regionalism, and globalization organize political life around the world. What trends and policies promote regional integration? What forces frustrate integration? To answer these questions this course investigates security, economic, and cultural relations at the beginning of the 21st century within Asia and between Asia and Russia and the U.S. This course looks at the historical interaction of national, regional, and global forces for additional answers. Offered periodically. Also counts toward Asian studies, Chinese, and Japanese majors and Asian studies and international relations concentrations. Prerequisite: previous course in Asian studies or political science, or permission of instructor."
