		"From Beyonc√© to bitcoin, from reality TV to Reddit, how can media, celebrity, and consumerism be claimed for poetry? As the line between high art and popular culture has continued to collapse, many poets have both embraced and critiqued pop and digital culture in their work. In this course, students read contemporary poetry that engages pop culture, explore the tensions between the pop and the poetic in their own poems, experiment with found poetry and other innovative writing methods, participate in peer workshops, and produce a final portfolio of new and revised poems."
