		"This course introduces students to historical narratives of Asian Americans in U.S. history from colonial times into the twenty-first century. In exploring Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South and Southeast Asian immigrant journeys, we will consider how people from Asia became Asian American by negotiated integration, forming and struggling with community, experiencing and combating racialization and the \"model minority\" myth, and engaging in political activism. Topics include cultural perceptions, immigration restriction, World War II and the Vietnam War, and the development of the Asian American Movement."
