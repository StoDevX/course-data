		"We now seem to live in a world with and without religion. This dimension of the world can be called the secular as a form of life, secularization as a social reality, and secularism as a perspective informing human ethics, politics, and life. Students consider how religion and the secular relate, their joint genesis in modern and ancient religious histories, and evaluate various proposals for their contemporary life together."
