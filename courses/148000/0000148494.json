		"This course focuses on social dance forms performed in pairs. Students work on developing the skills necessary for success with such forms, including communicating non-verbally with a partner, particularly in lead/follow situations; giving weight and counter-balancing with a partner; rotating as a pair while progressing around the floor, etc. Repertoire for the class includes a range of social/vernacular dance forms such as Viennese waltz, salsa rueda, rumba, schottische, and hambo, among others. May be repeated. Offered alternate years, usually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: DANCE 106 or DANCE 108 or DANCE 109 or DANCE 206 or permission of instructor."
