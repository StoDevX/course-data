		"The Nordic countries consistently top the list of the best places in the world to live, but what values have supported this outcome? This course examines three core Nordic values--equality, social solidarity, and sustainability--in light of Lutheran and secular traditions. Students examine texts that reflect how these core Nordic values developed and the current challenges facing them. Offered annually. Counts towards the Norwegian and Nordic Studies Majors and the Nordic Studies Concentration."
