		"This course for beginning and intermediate movers focuses on the dance concept of groove, and how it serves as a linkage between many American styles of music and dance that have African roots - from blues to jazz to hip hop styles. The class will be a hybrid of movement, reading, viewing, writing and creating to support both embodied and scholarly understanding and appreciation of the role groove plays in American dance culture/s."
