		"In this course students read (in English translation) and discuss 13 Greek tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and five Latin tragedies by Seneca. The focus is on comparing and contrasting the tragic heroines and the roles they play. Students write a response paper, a literary analysis, and a short research paper. They also consider how the tragedies would have been staged in the ancient world, and how have they been adapted in modern times."
