		"This is a 100-level course focused on a brief but extraordinarily complex decade, and one that is crucial for understanding the political and cultural debates of the present. The 1960s were years defined by movements for social and racial justice, decolonization and the Cold War, new media technologies and pop music, cultural experimentation, geopolitical conflict, and political realignment.From the United States to Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond, the Sixties serve a unique set of functions in our collective memory. Our class will examine how literature, film, music, advertisements, and television have continually cast and recast the history and meaning of this period to meet the demands of the present."
