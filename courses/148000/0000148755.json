		"This course explores various historical topics surrounding communities that live in, or have roots in, the region of Southeast Asia and beyond. Students in Transnational Histories will look at histories of interaction between people in and near Southeast Asia that transcend national boundaries and complicate our common notions of the nation as a discrete unit with set and impermeable bounds. Other topics include pre-modern trade systems, migration, encounters with colonialism, the Vietnam war, and diasporas."
