		"For some \"community dance\" encompasses the dances that are part of a community's social life. For others it refers specifically to a movement with the motto \"dance is for everyone\" that has sought to bring participation in dance to all, particularly underserved communities. This class addresses both. The class is open to all, both students with no experience and those with who are interested in potentially using community dance in future endeavors."
