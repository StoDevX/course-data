		"This course provides a deepening exploration of jazz dance studies, styles, and techniques for students at an intermediate level. Students acquire movement vocabulary within the jazz idiom while developing skills in: efficiency and ease of movement, proper body alignment, isolation of body parts, diversity of rhythmic patterns, and exploring a range of dynamics and energetic qualities within their dancing. The course emphasizes the historical roots of jazz dance and jazz music. Students will engage in a survey of embodied practices connecting our jazz studies to their African and Latin diasporic roots, vernacular dance forms, improvisation, and learning a broad stylistic range of jazz dance choreography. Previous Jazz dance experience required."
