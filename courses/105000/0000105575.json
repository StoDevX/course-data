		"Many aspects of our lives and our society are influenced by the ideas (or the theories) of economists.

While the ideas of many important figures are covered, economists such as Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Marshall, and Keynes receive particular attention. Offered annually. Prerequisite: one of Economics 110-121 or permission of instructor."
