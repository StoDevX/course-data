		"Abraham's Children Daily news reports regarding violence between Jews, Christians, and Muslims make it difficult to remember that these religions share common roots. Yet, all three trace their lineage back to Abraham. This section explores the common roots of these religions by introducing students to the Bible and the Qurâ€™an, and examining their parallel characters and narratives. At the same time, distinctive beliefs and practices of each religion that are grounded in scripture will be investigated to better understand what makes each religious tradition unique. In our pluralistic world, a basic understanding of the relationship between these three monotheistic religions may be more valuable now than ever before."

Students study major Biblical texts and their interaction with, for example, theology, religious practice, ethics, and social values, while considering methods and fields in the study of religion in a liberal arts setting. An additional prospectus describes the theme of each section."
