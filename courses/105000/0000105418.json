	"desc": "This seminar examines one of history's most dramatic episodes: the Spanish conquest and colonization of Mexico. Through the reading of manifestos, letters, and chronicles of the period, students examine such topics as European and indigenous perceptions of the conquest, the role of missionaries, native efforts to resist Spanish domination, the ecological/biological consequences of 1492, and subsequent debates over the morality and meaning of the conquest. Offered periodically. Counts toward the History and Latin American Studies major, and the Latin American Studies concentration.",
