		"This course introduces students to ecocriticism as a method of literary study by surveying English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Students read ecocritical theory and study poetry, plays, and prose works by authors including William Shakespeare, John Milton, and Margaret Cavendish. Possible course themes include pastoral, sugar and slavery, consumption and waste, the Scientific Revolution, and animals. Assignments use digital technology to gather data, analyze literature in its historical context, and write for collaborative scholarly research initiatives. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW."
