		"This two-semester in-depth course addresses topics in classical and modern physics using algebra, geometry, and some calculus. The course is well-suited for students of biology or chemistry or for those desiring a thorough introduction beyond the high-school level.",
		"Physics 125 explores the character of electric and magnetic forces and fields, then takes up the extended description of matter (vibrations, waves - sound and light). Finally, both particle and wave descriptions are shown to be necessary for discussing quantum mechanics and its application to atomic physics. Students attend lectures and one 2.5-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the spring semester. Does not count toward physics major. Prerequisites: MATH 119 or MATH 120 or equivalent and PHYS 124."
