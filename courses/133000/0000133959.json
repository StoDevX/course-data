	"description": [
		"Using visual art as a lens, students examine vision starting with light and its interactions with matter as well as optical and physiological responses to art elements: elements; value, color, line, shape, form, and texture. Students scientifically analyze artworks using tools from physics, neurobiology, and psychology seeking strategies employed by visual artists to create compelling images and adopt these strategies to generate original work. No prerequisites, but foundational experience in studio art or art history is valuable. Offered alternate years during Interim. Does not count toward physics major. Counts toward neuroscience concentration"
