		"This course takes a case-study approach to the fitting and assessment of statistical models with application to real data. Specific topics include multiple regression, model diagnostics, and logistic regression. The approach focuses on problem-solving tools, interpretation, mathematical models underlying analysis methods, and written statistical reports. Offered each semester. Also counts toward environmental studies major (natural science and social science emphases) and management studies, mathematical biology, and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisite: STAT 110 or STAT 212 or ECON 263 or equivalent preparation, or permission of instructor."
