		"Students study the progression of the U.S. social welfare \"system\" from English Poor Laws through the Social Security Act to contemporary reforms. They examine how its components (public, private, faith-based) interrelate to serve diverse individuals, families, and communities. The development of social work, its foundational knowledge, values, and skills, and its relationship to fields of social welfare are included. Students shadow a social worker for four hours. Offered each semester. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and family studies and race and ethnic studies concentrations."
