	"description": "Throughout history, playwrights have represented the human condition in a wide variety of forms and styles, with intentions ranging from the profound to the absurd. This course surveys approximately 24 works of dramatic literature, exploring how playwrights employ structure, character, and narrative in creating live performances. The emphasis is on performance, and the knowledge of the plays will be used in later theater courses. Offered annually.",
