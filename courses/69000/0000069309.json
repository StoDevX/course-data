		"This course provides an overview of the major thinkers who sought to create a science of human society, the ideas they found fundamental to a science of society and how human society changes through history. Classical thinkers such as Marx, Durkheim, Simmel, Weber, and Mead are studied along with the schools of theory which they inspired: positivism, interpretive and critical conflict theory. Open to Sociology/Anthropology majors only. Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course. Offered annually in the Spring Semester."
