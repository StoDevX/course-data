		"Immigration policy and welfare reform exemplify how society's values and needs translate into policies and programs. Social workers work for justice by creating, implementing and evaluating policies in health, employment, housing and child welfare. Students study policy formation and analysis that reflect interests and powers of diverse groups as well as economic and social needs of certain populations at risk, especially women, people in poverty, African-Americans, gay men and lesbians and Latinos. Open to non-majors by permission of instructor. Offered annually in the Spring Semester."
