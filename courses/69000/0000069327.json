		"This course takes a case-study approach to the fitting and assessment of statistical models with application to real data. Specific topics include two-sample comparisons, simple linear regression, multiple regression, model diagnostics, and logistic regression for binary response variables. Students focus on problem-solving tools, interpretation, mathematical models underlying analysis methods, and written statistical reports. Prerequisite: Statistics 110 or 212 or 263, or equivalent preparation or permission of instructor. Offered each semester. May not take Statistics 110, Statistics 212, or Statistics 263 after completion of Statistics 272."
