	"desc": "This class covers the basics of news and public affairs writing. Students learn how to find a good story, interview, research, write, and ultimately edit their own stories. And because print news heads the twenty-first century endangered-industry list and several iconic newspapers have recently shut down in this country, the course confronts squarely the question of where news writing -- and the field of journalism itself -- is heading. Students learn to write for online news sources and to design a news blog -- and maybe even write a twitter or two.",
