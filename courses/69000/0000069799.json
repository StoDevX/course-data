	"description": "This course addresses computational problems arising from the need to store, access, transform, and utilize DNA-related data. Topics from computer science central to the development of problem-solving tools include: exhaustive search; algorithms (including dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, graph and greedy algorithms); combinatorial pattern matching; clustering and trees; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites: Computer Science 253, or Computer Science 121 and Biology 125, or Computer Science 121 and Mathematics 222, or permission of instructor. Next offered in Spring 2011 and Spring 2013.",
