		"How ought citizens respond to threats to national security from terrorists and distant states? The course examines Just War theory and Jihad to enquire about the connections between religions and political violence. It considers the strategic logic of terrorism and the ethical 'costs' of responses to it. It examines conflicts between Islamic 'moderates' and 'extremists' to reveal the ethical and political spectrums within Islam. Offered annually. Required prior experience of political analysis or the study of religion."
