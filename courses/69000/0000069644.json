	"description": "Sample Topic: The Psychology of Good and Evil\nWhy do we feel it is important to judge behavior as morally good or bad? How do we make these judgments? What makes it possible for people to commit acts of extraordinary heroism or evil?

Students read both and ask how they do (and should) inform each other. Prerequisite: Psychology 230 and Psychology 249.",
