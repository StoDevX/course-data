		"In this course students will gain an appreciation for the drug development process, including how natural products are isolated, how their structures relate to activities, and how research into the mechanism of disease leads to the targeted development of drugs. Issues relating to medicinal chemistry in a developing-world context, medicinal plants, and the chemical basis of folk medicine will be discussed. Prerequisites: Chemistry 248 and 254. Offered alternate years during Interim."
