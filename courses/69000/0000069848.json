		"This course covers basic enumeration, including generating functions, recursion, inclusion-exclusion, Polya theory, etc. Students also explore topics in graph theory and constructive combinatorics, time permitting. Prerequisite: Mathematics 252; some previous exposure to counting methods (e.g., Mathematics 232 or Mathematics 262) is helpful. Offered in 2009-10 and alternate years."
