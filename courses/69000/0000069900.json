Students examine two forms of travel: traditional Buddhist pilgrimages, and modern forms of tourism. The course explores Buddhist and Christian forms of pilgrimage, comparing their motivations, practices, and consequences in relation to each tradition's ethical ideals. Tourism raises ethical issues, including economic justice, environmental impact, sustainability, and the quality of interactions between tourists and local cultures. Prerequisite: BTS-B.",
