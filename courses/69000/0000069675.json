	"description": [
		"This course brings Environmental Studies, Art and Art History, and other students together to explore what artists like Christo and Jeanne-Claude, who have made earthworks and land art since 1970, have taught society about the environment and how environmental thinking has reshaped the character and outlook of those who have pursued land art. The course will count for humanities credit among Environmental Studies majors and can count as an art history course among Studio and Art History majors. Students enrolling in it should have some background in environmental studies or art/art history or should speak to the instructor."
