		"This course provides an overview of the major thinkers who sought to create a science of human society, the ideas they found fundamental to a science of society and how human society changes through history.

Open to Sociology/Anthropology majors only. Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course. Offered annually in the Spring Semester."
