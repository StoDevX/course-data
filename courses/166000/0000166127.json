		"This course examines visual art created in Europe between 1300 and 1650, a time when Europe's colonial and economic power in the world was growing. The course considers how Europeans visualized the people and geographies of their world, how religious belief and conflict shaped visual traditions, and how works of art reflect conceptions of sex and gender. Offered alternate years in fall semester."
