		"In this course students read and analyze a selection of 20th- and 21st-century Japanese novels and short stories in English translation, and then watch film adaptations of the same works. Students analyze the literary and cinematic works in terms of cultural themes, artistic expression, and specific socio-historical contexts. Students learn and apply introductory approaches to adaptation theory, and consider the creative process of adapting literary works to film. Taught in English. No knowledge of Japanese required. Evening film screenings are required in addition to class meetings. Offered periodically during January term."
