		"In this course, we examine the evolution of the medieval cultures of the East Slavic lands, called Rusâ€™, from the arrival of Christianity to the founding of the Russian Empire. We examine changing conceptions of time and discourses of light and darkness in folklore, literature, architecture, sacred art, and ritual, to understand the evolving forms of life and worldview in medieval Rus'. A field trip to the Museum of Russian Art is planned."
