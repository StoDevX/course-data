		"This course is an introduction to PPE, an interdisciplinary field that pursues the powerful connections among its three defining disciplines (philosophy, politics, and economics). Students engage with core topics in the field - such as markets, collective action, justice, and public choice - from a variety of ideological perspectives, such as libertarianism, Marxism, liberalism, and feminism. They learn how to integrate different disciplinary approaches in application to both theoretical and policy debates. Not open to first-year students except by special permission. Offered annually during fall semester."
