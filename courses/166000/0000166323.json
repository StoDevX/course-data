		"This course examines the Cold War (1945-1991) outward from the \"West\" and the Communist world, and emerging nations throughout Africa, Asia, and South America. Students analyze and discuss major conceptual themes of ideological conflict, collective action, and technological change, and read, discuss, and write to develop their own ideas and challenge our notions of this global story and what it has meant -and continues to mean- for the past."
