		"This course traces the history of human rights, politics, and ideas in Latin America. Students examine strategies which people have used to claim rights, ask how people developed ideas of \"the human\" in the colonial era, examine how independence problematized the idea of universal rights, and watch the development of human rights politics in the twentieth century. Students critically examine human rights and challenges to their realization across the region. Offered annually in the spring."
