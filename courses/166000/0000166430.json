		"This seminar examines the development of LGBT communities in a broad range of national contexts, urban and rural sexual subcultures, and the related histories of regulation, medicalization, and categorization. In addition to exploring major theoretical influences on queer and trans history, including Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Jen Manion, this course allows students to pursue research on the lived experiences and biographies of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans Europeans, 1789-2000."
