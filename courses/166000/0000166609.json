		"This course examines the ethics of ambition and leadership through diverse normative perspectives. By exploring historical examples and theoretical approaches from Plato to the present, students reflect on ambition as both a fundamental human drive and a key force in civic leadership. They also assess its moral and practical risks for individuals and communities. Finally, students consider how their own ambitions relate to their personal and public roles within a political community. Offered alternate years during spring semester."
