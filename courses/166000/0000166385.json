		"This creative writing course focuses on craft issues of place and historical research, as well as how both travel and other art forms can fuel the writing process. The first half of the course, based at St. Olaf, acquaints students with the tools of fiction through exercises and readings, while also preparing for flash fiction writing projects to be developed during two weeks in Tuscany, Italy, which has long served as home or inspiration for writers. Offered periodically during January term. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or above."
