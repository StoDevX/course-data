		"Ecosystem Health introduces students to the core concepts and skills necessary to engage in the rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary fields of One Health and Planetary Health. With broad applications in environmental science and public health, the course emphasizes the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Central to the course is systems thinking, which provides students with tools to understand and analyze the complexity of ecological and health systems. Through the lens of complexity theory, students will develop a holistic perspective critical for addressing pressing global grand challenges at the interface of health and the environment. This class covers a broad range of topics, including environmental toxicology, sustainable agriculture and food security, biodiversity and health, migration and population dynamics, infectious diseases, and zoonotic diseases. Prerequisite: ENVST 137 or any natural science course."
