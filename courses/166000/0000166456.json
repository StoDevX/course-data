		"This course introduces students to queer of color theory, literature, and film. Its focus is the intersectionality of sexuality, gender, race, class, and language, and the contributions of Black and Latinx writers to queer knowledge. It explores how their work creates and expands sexuality and gender studies beyond the universalism that plagues \"mainstream\" queer theory. Offered alternate years during fall semester."
