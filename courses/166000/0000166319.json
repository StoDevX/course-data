		"This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to Latin America. A central theme is the complex and recurring dynamics of traditions and change that have characterized Latin America since its inception more than five centuries ago. This includes examining how traditions are constructed and change, how they are maintained and/or revitalized by mixing new with old, local with regional and global, ideology with practice, as well as how new traditions are formed."
