		"Though their career as a recording group lasted only about seven years and ended over half a century ago, the Beatles are still considered one of the most important creative collaborations of the twentieth century. In this course, students practice cultural analysis by examining the Beatles' musical, lyrical, and cultural works, focusing on their creative evolution in the context of social, cultural, and technological developments during the 1960s."
