		"This course views the history and legacy of the World Wars through three thematic lenses: the shock of modernity, the contradictions of empire, and collective memory. From the metropole to the colonial periphery, individuals in the largest cities and the smallest villages experienced rapid and seismic upheaval, including extraordinary technological change, political and social revolution, economic depression, totalitarianism, nuclear war, and the Holocaust."
