		"The fate of the queer community in Russia has been characterized by constant twists and turns between decriminalization and \"re-criminalization\". Homophobic Russian rhetoric embraces the popular view that homosexuality is essentially un-Russian. On the other hand, Western discourse often Orientalizes Russia as 'traditional', 'premodern' or 'underdeveloped' in its homophobia. This course, which considers queer Russian literature from modernist to contemporary authors, pushes back against both of these restrictive points of view. Prerequisite: One 200-level course in Russian Studies or Gender and Sexuality Studies"
