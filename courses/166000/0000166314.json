		"Through role playing simulations, students examine events, institutions, and doctrines of the Revolutionary era in France and Haiti, with special attention to the 18th-century background to the political, social, and philosophical roots of the Revolution and its impact on the world in the 19th century. Using primary and secondary sources, students experience and examine the drama of the period and consider the variety of historical approaches to, and interpretations of, the Revolution. Offered periodically."
