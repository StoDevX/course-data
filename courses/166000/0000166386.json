		"Students explore constructions of Europe by critically engaging with museums and heritage sites in two European cultural capitals and their vicinities. Travel experiences serve as the core course \"texts,\" with students entrusted with facilitating their cohort's learning. On excursions, students experience first-hand architecture, artifacts, and artworks they encounter across St. Olaf's liberal arts curriculum. In class discussions and reflective writing, they consider the ways in which those sites and objects delineate and disrupt cultural borders. Offered alternate years during January term."
