		"Students continue to develop oral language skills through in-class and language lab activities with both audio and video tapes. Regular written assignments aid in the expansion of vocabulary and in the practical application of grammatical concepts. Communicating in German about familiar personal topics, students acquire vocabulary about sports, food, holidays, school, the environment, life in German cities, Austrian and Swiss culture, and German reunification. Prerequisite: German 111 or placement by test."
