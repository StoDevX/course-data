		"This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to the roughly 300-year period of Western European history from the Fall of the Roman Empire to the establishment of the 6th-century Christian Germanic kingdoms. Using primary sources, archaeological evidence, and remains of art and architecture, students investigate the collapse of Roman authority and the rise of the Christian Church, gaining insight into an age of great transition and change. Offered periodically during Interim."
