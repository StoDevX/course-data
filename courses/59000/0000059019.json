Writers include Jonathan Lethem, Arundhati Roy, Barbara Kingsolver, Jhumpa Lahiri, Sue Miller, Nick Hornby, Zadie Smith, and Jonathan Safran Foer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FALL 2007 - Students explore various forms of prose, including fiction and creative nonfiction.
