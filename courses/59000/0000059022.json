		"An interdisciplinary approach to war and peace, this course incorporates the dual perspective of philosophy and history. Students study various ethical arguments as shaped in different cultures. Examples are drawn from ancient Athens, medieval Christendom, Asia, Islam, and the modern West; ethical topics include: pacifism, utilitarianism, divine command ethics, natural law theory, feminism, and cultural relativism. The course begins with warfare as treated in the Bible and concludes with nuclear terrorism."
