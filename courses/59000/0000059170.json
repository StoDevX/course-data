		"Mexicans dying to enter the U.S. Moroccans dying to enter Spain. Europeans reluctant to accept Turkey's EU bid out of fear of more migrants. Britons worried that migrants fuel terrorism. Headlines worldwide draw attention to transnational migration. This course covers explanations of entry control policy, integration and citizenship policy, and the political activities of migrants in the wealthy democracies.
