		"The discussion of wilderness today often focuses on non-human benefits, such as the protection of biodiversity or wildlife habitat. A significant tradition of American thought and literature also emphasizes the benefits of wilderness for human beings, including spirituality, freedom, morality, self-reliance, and solitude. This seminar, offered annually, explores the importance of wilderness in American thought and assesses its value for society today."
