	"description": [
		"With their tales of shape-shifting, vengeance, heroic quests, and tragic turns of fortune, the myths of the ancient Greeks and Romans have long inspired artists, poets, and philosophers. Even today, they continue to influence how human beings view the world and interact with one another. In this course students read thought-provoking stories about gods, heroes, and mortals, explore them in their original contexts, and investigate their connections with modern times and with students' own experiences. Offered annually. Also counts toward ancient studies, Greek, and Latin majors."
