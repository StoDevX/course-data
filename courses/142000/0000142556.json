		"The US is often referred to as a \"nation of immigrants.\" But who does this idea include and who does it leave out? How is immigration history a part of our present? How do immigrantsâ€™ stories deepen our understanding about public attitudes and policies? Do all immigrants have the same ability to move through and beyond national borders? What impacts do immigration law, policy, and enforcement have on immigrants and the country as a whole? This course provides students an overview of U.S. immigration history and an introduction to scholarly methods, approaches, and debates that shape understandings of migration. We will consider histories of race and colonialism alongside insights from Native American, African American, Asian American, and Chicana/o Studies."
