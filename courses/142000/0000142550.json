		"This course examines poetry written by African poets who have emerged since the 1980s. Students study the factors that have influenced the development of African poetry and learn to evaluate how literature enacts and reflects the efforts of individuals and groups to negotiate political, social, and cultural contexts. Course materials and discussions invite the exploration of African poets and their poetic personas as witnesses, activists, and spokespeople, and their struggle against tyranny, dictatorship, oppression, and injustice. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW or WRR."
