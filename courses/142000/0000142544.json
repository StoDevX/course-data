		"Comparative theology is the study and interpretation of one religion in conversation with the texts, symbols, and practices of other religious traditions. It aims to discover new theological insights from another or from one's own tradition. The readings for this course explore the nature of comparative theology as a method of doing theology, drawing upon both theoretical paradigms in the field and religious texts contributing to Christianity's dialogue with other movements and traditions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, Shinto, Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese Traditional Religion, African Diasporic Traditions, Wicca/Neo-Paganism, indigenous religions and spiritualities, and New Religious Movements. Offered annually."
