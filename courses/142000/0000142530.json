		"Building on explorations in the Fall and Interim, this seminar will examine the following questions: What motivates and inspires human beings to nurture existing relationships with their environment and/or to seek a change in those relationships? What are strategies and actions for solving environmental challenges? What role will I play in Earth's future? (and in my community...). In navigating these questions, we will look through an interdisciplinary lens, engaging with a sustained research paper, creating art, and thinking about how we can take scholarship and personal explorations and translate them into civic engagement."
