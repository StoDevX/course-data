		"Hollywood and other popular cinemas around the world divide their film narratives into different genres like melodrama, horror, musicals, science fiction, film noir, and gangster cinema. Some of these genres stem from literature and theater, and most have subsequently influenced television, video games, and other media production. In this course students analyze the history and characteristics of one of these genres in detail or compare and contrast influential examples of genre production. May be repeated if topics are different. Offered alternate years in the fall semester beginning fall semester 2021-22."
