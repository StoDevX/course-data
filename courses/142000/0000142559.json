		"This course teaches students how to develop a business or not-for-profit venture concept using the Design Thinking Process. Students work in teams to identify a customer need, design a strategy, and determine feasibility of the proposed venture. Ethical practice permeates these discussions. Weekly assignments develop the necessary speaking skills that prepare students for the final plan presentation. Local entrepreneurs and fellow students critique the final plan and offer suggestions. Offered annually in the spring. Prerequisite: sophomore standing or above."
