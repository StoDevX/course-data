		"\"Multiethnolects\" is a collective term for urban contact languages that develop in multiethnic neighborhoods. Students learn to analyze the language structure of multiethnolects, the role of language in social groups, and how people express their identities through language. They also investigate perspectives on multiethnolects from outside the speech community, e.g., how attitudes towards \"non-standard\" languages influence public debates, and how those debates on language are used as a battleground for resistance against societal change. Offered periodically in the spring semester.Also counts toward the German and Norwegian majors. Also counts toward the German studies and Nordic studies concentrations. Prerequisite: LNGST 250 or equivalent."
