		"An intimate connection grows between us and the places we call home. This seminar takes this connection as its starting point, investigating our private spaces and those we share, sometimes unwillingly, with strangers. To this end, we will discuss sociological studies about how we express ourselves in the spaces we inhabit, consider some of the philosophical connections between domestic spaces and the people we have the capacity to become, and examine the history of the rooms and technologies we live in and with every day. To help us investigate these topics thoughtfully, we will draw from literary nonfiction, history, sociology, literary criticism, philosophy, and journalism. These readings will come from both traditional academic sources as well as popular ones. Essays will include a close reading of an image, a researched history of a domestic room or technology, and a response to a philosophical argument about the power of spaces to shape who we are."
