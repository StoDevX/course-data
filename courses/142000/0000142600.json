Students learn and apply introductory approaches to adaptation theory, and consider the creative process of adapting literary works to film. Taught in English. No knowledge of Japanese required. Evening film screenings are required in addition to class meetings. Offered periodically during interim. Also counts toward Japanese and film studies majors. Also counts toward film studies concentration."
