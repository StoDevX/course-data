		"Korea is now the only divided country in the world and is technically at war since its armistice in 1953. Its division continues to pose a serious security threat to its neighbors in Asia and the U.S. This course will engage students to explore the following questions and think about strategic interactions among states. How did Korea come to be divided in the first place? What role did the U.S. play in its division? How did South Korea, which was as poor as Ghana (per capita income of $490) in the 1950s achieve such a rapid economic growth ($4,832) by 1990 and outdo both Ghana ($481) and North Korea ($725)? Do people in each country want Korea to be reunified? What do their neighboring countries think about their reunification? How are South Korea and its allies coping with North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs? What effect does K-pop have on inter-Korean relations and on its diplomatic ties with China and Japan? Can soft power enable South Korea to overcome geopolitics?"
