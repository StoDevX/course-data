		"The Cold War was more than a geopolitical contest between two rival superpowers, but a global phenomenon that transformed societies, cultures, and communities throughout the world. We will follow the ongoing competition between capitalism and communism, but also the process of decolonization and the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War and global protests of 1968, the promise of detente, and the environmental movements of the 1980s. We will focus on the role of popular culture in this period, as film, music, television, and print media were not merely influenced by the dynamics of the Cold War, but rather in their creativity and power were able to change the course of history."
