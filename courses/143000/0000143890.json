		"How have the events of 2020 impacted you? The COVID-19 pandemic robbed hundreds of thousands of their lives and all of us of our daily habits. The murder of George Floyd spawned a worldwide uprising over racial injustice. Through it all, teachers and schools have been tasked with delivering instruction, creating community in online classrooms, and supporting students during the most challenging school year in memory. In this class we will explore what the year has meant for teachers, learners and schools through readings, podcasts, personal reflections, class discussions and case studies. What have we learned from 2020 and how can it be used as a set of experiences to foster growth and radical change in education in the years to come?"
