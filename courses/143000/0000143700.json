		"Through critical source analysis and iterative writing, students will examine \"magical\" behavior from ancient Sumeria, Egypt, the Hebraic Kingdoms, Greece and Rome. As a methods seminar for the History major, the focus of the course will be on the comparative historiographic context and the ways in which historians (both ancient and modern) have constructed their analysis of ancient magic."
