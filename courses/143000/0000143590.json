		"This course examines Latin America’s colonial history from 1492 to 1898. We will examine the history of Spanish, Portuguese and French imperialism in the region through the eyes of the people who lived it: indigenous commoners and nobles, enslaved and freed people, women and children, scientists and entrepreneurs. With a specific focus on the history of human interaction with the region’s diverse ecologies and the development of capitalism, on colonial law and the history of race and gender, we will ask how colonial society took shape, how these empires sustained themselves and why they eventually collapsed. Students will gain an appreciation for Latin America’s central role in the modern history of global interconnection and understand how the specific dynamics of imperialism established the foundation for Latin America’s postcolonial history. Also counts toward Latin American studies major and concentration."
