		"In what ways do language and race intersect? How do individuals use language to signal their belonging to a given community as well as to distinguish themselves from others? How are particular languages, dialects, and ways of speaking involved in the construction of privileged or stigmatized identities? This course will explore the varied and sometimes surprising intersection of language, race, and identity. We will look at linguistic discrimination and how it impacts the survival of non-dominant languages and cultures, the educational success of children, equity in the workplace, and inter-racial/ ethnic conflict. We will also analyze the explosion of linguistic appropriation, such as white teensâ€™ use of black vernacular English or the casual use of the Hindi religious term \"namaste\" in American yoga settings. Readings will be drawn from the emerging field of Raciolinguistics, but we will also look at examples of linguistic stereotyping and discrimination on social media platforms, in film and advertising, as well as in our policing and judicial systems. You will have the opportunity to design and propose an original, relevant final project on a topic and in a format of your choosing."
