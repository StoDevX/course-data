		"In this seminar, we explore concepts of identity--the qualities and characteristics that define us as individuals and as members of various groups and institutions, from home communities to college campuses, from athletic teams to political and religious organizations. We'll read theories about Generation Z, a memoir of civil rights and environmental activism, and essays about race, class, and gender as we consider how social factors impact identities and the ways identities shape our perspectives and opinions. This section is writing intensive and focuses intentionally on the writing process. Projects emphasize expressing opinion, analyzing course texts, researching and analyzing how a movement or event presents itself, and responding to opinion. The final project is to reflect, using words and images, on influences that inform your identities and the person you imagine becoming."
