		"This course investigates the origins of the early U.S. republic through the life of its first Secretary of Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. In addition to key events in Hamilton's life, it explores a wide range of topics including life in the British Caribbean, the American Revolution, and Hamilton's role in forging partisan politics. Utilizing newspapers, pamphlets, and other writings from the time, students gain a first-hand look at the issues that defined the era. The course culminates with reflections of Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit Broadway musical and its contemporary relevance. Offered periodically."
