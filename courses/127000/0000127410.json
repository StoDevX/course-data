		"This course teaches students how to develop a business or not-for-profit venture concept into a business plan. Students choose whether to develop a real business plan for a local entrepreneur or pursue an idea of their choice. Students work in teams to identify a market need, design a strategy, and determine feasibility of the proposed venture. Ethical practice permeates these discussions. Weekly assignments develop the necessary speaking skills that prepare students for the final plan presentation. Local entrepreneurs and fellow students critique the final plan and offer suggestions. Offered during Interim. Does not count toward the finance or management area of emphasis."
