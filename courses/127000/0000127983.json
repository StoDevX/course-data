		"This course studies the New Testament in light of its cultural, political, and religious contexts, with a special focus on the intersection of religion and empire. Utilizing the tools of postcolonial interpretation, it focuses on the question, \"How did followers of Jesus live out their faith in the complex religious, political, social and economic contexts of the Roman Empire?\" Visits to archaeological and cultural sites throughout Greece enable students to explore: 1) the relationship of politics, culture and religion in the Book of Acts, the Letters of Paul, and other writings of the New Testament and antiquity; and 2) the religious pluralism of the first century Roman world, including the Jewish and Hellenistic contexts with which the New Testament authors are engaged. The course also studies other significant developments in the early church of this region, provides encounters with the Greek Orthodox branch of Christianity, and explores biblical, cultural, and social relationships between Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Offered during Interim. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
