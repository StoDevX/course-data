They analyze films using a variety of theoretical models and explore the connection between the present and the interpretation in film of famous past episodes in U.S. history, including, but not limited to, the American Revolution, the Civil War, Custer's \"Last Stand,\" and the turbulent events of the 1960s. Required writing assignments enable students to demonstrate their analytical skills. Group projects offer the opportunity to write screenplays. Offered during Interim."
