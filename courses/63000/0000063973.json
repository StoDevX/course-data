		"Integrating the human body, the digital video camera, and the computer, students explore the creation and performance of movement as artistic expression. Emphasizing conceptual and practical approaches, students learn basic artistic movement technique and composition, video production and editing, and computer animation of the human form. Students produce a number of individual and group movement projects. Students perform, view, describe, and analyze class projects. Students examine and discuss a wide variety of dances made for the camera. The class culminates with an evening public showing. No prerequisites or previous dance or computer experience required. Materials fee. Offered alternate years during Interim."
