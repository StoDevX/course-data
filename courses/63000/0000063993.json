The course develops in an itinerant way -- city to city -- starting in L\u00fcbeck, Germany, then proceeding eastward to the cities of Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wolgast, Szczecin, Koszalin, Danzig, Malbork, Ketrzyn, Vilnius, Kaunas, the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (formerly K\u00f6nigsberg in Germany's East Prussia), Klaipeda, Riga, Tartu, Tallinn, crossing by ship to Helsinki, Finland, and again by ship to Stockholm, Sweden. Students will deliver many oral presentations, including a group project of a business plan for a hypothetical start -up.",
