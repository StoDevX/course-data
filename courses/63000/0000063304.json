		"Emphasizing individual concepts, personal expression and strong composition, this course explores relief and lithography.

Students become familiar with the heritage of old masters as well as contemporary artists in printmaking. Prerequisites: Art 102 or Art 111 and 112 (or 110). Materials fee. Offered annually."
