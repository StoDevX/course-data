		"Lord Tennyson called Vergil the \"wielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man.\" Students encounter that stately measure when they translate selections from Vergil's three major poems (Eclogues, Georgics, Aeneid). They also engage in spirited discussion of Homer's influence on Vergil and of Vergil's influence on the literature, art, and music of Western civilization.
