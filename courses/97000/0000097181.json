		"EnvSt 281 History of Energy in the U.S. and the World: Energy is central to modern life, yet it is seldom the focus of historical study. This course examines the history of the United States and the world through the lens of major energy resources. Students consider the significant impact of energy on the nation's political, diplomatic, military, social, cultural, scientific, business, and economic histories, as well as the corresponding impact that the U.S. has had on energy resources and the environment."
