		"The Norwegian artist Edvard Munch not only painted one of the world's most famous paintings (\"The Scream\"), he also produced a remarkable body of psychological and expressionist artworks from the 1880s to the 1930s. This course uses Munch's art as a window onto Nordic literature in a period of transition from naturalism to modernism. Students explore the work of writers with significant connections to Munch, investigating the interplay between art and literature in fin-de-si√®cle Scandivavia. Counts toward Norwegian major and Nordic studies concentration. Offered periodically."
