		"Students study computational problems arising from the need to store, access, transform, and utilize DNA-related data. Topics from computer science include: exhaustive search; algorithms (including dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, graph and greedy algorithms) for fragment reassembly, sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees; combinatorial pattern matching; clustering and trees; and hidden Markov models. Prerequisites: CSCI 253, or one of CSCI 121 or CSCI 125 and one of BIO 125 or MATH 220, or permission of instructor. Offered alternate years. Counts toward neuroscience and mathematical biology concentrations and mathematics major."
