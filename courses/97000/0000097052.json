	"desc": "This two-semester in-depth course addresses topics in classical and modern physics using algebra, geometry, and some calculus. The course is well-suited for students of biology or chemistry or for those desiring a thorough introduction beyond the high-school level.\nPhysics 125 explores the character of electric and magnetic forces and fields, then takes up the extended description of matter (vibrations, waves - sound and light). Finally, both particle and wave descriptions are shown to be necessary for discussing quantum mechanics and its application to atomic physics. One laboratory meeting per week. Prerequisites: Mathematics 120 or equivalent and Physics 124. Offered annually in the spring semester.",
