		"Explore pulse and rhythm through a range of dance and movement activities, including body and vocal percussion, clogging, drumming, and tap dancing. Investigate how physical rhythms are established as students shift body weight, manipulate time, and emphasize a pulse. Explore the connections between rhythm, the innate instinct to follow rhythmic patterns in life, and the predisposition to generate one's own rhythms. Join the beat! P/N only. Offered periodically."
