		"The personal essay may contain rumination, memoir, anecdote, diatribe, scholarship, fantasy, and moral philosophy. Students read and write about the personal essay from its origins to the present day as well as craft their own personal essays. Readings range from founding father Montaigne to classic practitioners Charles Lamb and Virginia Woolf; students also explore international essayists such as Wole Soyinka and American voices from Thoreau to Annie Dillard. Prerequisites: FYW and at least sophomore status. Offered during Interim."
