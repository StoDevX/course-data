	"description": [
		"This course explores the relationship between thought and society and examines how \"reality\" and \"truth\" develop from social practices, including the position from which sociology itself speaks. This relation is central to the meaning of sociology and its implicit critique of other disciplines' claims to truth, such as philosophy and the physical sciences. Students examine how sociology challenges the very idea of what knowledge is. It challenges the hypothesis that knowledge is not ultimately a transcendental thing that exists independently of social practice, but it is something produced in and by such practice. Prerequisite: SOAN 291."
