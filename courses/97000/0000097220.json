		"The ability to reproduce is one of the key features of a living organism. Studying the biology of reproduction requires a synthesis of information and concepts from a wide range of fields within biology. This course addresses reproduction at the genetic, organismal, and population levels. Laboratory work adds a valuable investigative component to the course, and social/psychological issues are addresssed throughout. Prerequisites: BIO 150 or BIO 126, or permission of instructor. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category. Counts toward women's and gender studies major and concentration if approved by petition."
