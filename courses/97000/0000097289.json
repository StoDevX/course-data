	"description": "Students encounter the cultural history of Brazil through the lens of its music, focusing on the critical interdisciplinary study of Brazil's core musical traditions and how those traditions reflect Brazil's multifaceted historical and cultural narrative. Moreover, students explore how Brazilian musical productions have engaged in political and socio-cultural debates in order to negotiate Brazil's complex cross-cultural identity across time. Neither advanced musical training nor Portuguese language ability are required for participation in the course. Counts toward Latin American major and concentration. Offered during summer.",
