		"Within the contemporary context, humanity's place within Earth's ecological system is fraught with ethical challenges. This course examines the Christian ethical tradition as a means to identify ethical resources for addressing ecological problems as well as reflect on how nature itself challenges ethical reflection. Students will investigate particular moral issues relating to sustainability and ecological concerns. The course will cover why and how God calls Christians to tend and sustain creation.
