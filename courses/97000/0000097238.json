		"This course explores the history and culture of cities in the United States, ranging from the industrial cities in the later-19th century to efforts to design sustainable cities in the 21st century. We will pay attention to the spatial, social, and physical history of cities, as well as the changing images of cities in American culture. While focused on cities themselves, we also will look at the changing relationship between cities and suburbs and the development of metropolitan America. The course will be a mixture of discussions, lectures, and presentations. We will make use of literature, film, and a range of primary sources to study cities."
