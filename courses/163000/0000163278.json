		"The course is rooted in advanced nutrition science and behavior-change psychology. Students examine the roles nutrient selection, metabolism, and timing play in supporting physical performance as well as mental and emotional health. Students discuss the integration and regulation of metabolism, energy expenditure, hydration, sleep, stress, and recovery; and they conduct an advanced overview of the functions of macronutrients, micronutrients, fluids, and supplements that are determinants of health and diseases. Offered annually. Prerequisite: BIO 143 and BIO 243; kinesiology major."
