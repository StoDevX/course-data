		"The idea of evolution forms the foundation for all modern biological thought. This course examines the processes of evolution in detail (selection, genetic drift, mutation, migration) and studies the methods by which biologists reconstruct the history of life on the planet. Advanced topics are explored through reading and discussion of journal articles. The social and historical context of evolutionary theory is discussed. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Also counts toward biomolecular science and mathematical biology concentrations. Prerequisite: BIO 233."
