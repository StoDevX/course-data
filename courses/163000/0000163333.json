		"The course begins with a survey of several popular programming languages, learning to write some code in each of them. We then consider important language features that have been used to describe entire categories of languages. Topics include programming language semantics, programming language translation, parsing, memory structures, abstraction mechanisms, and language translation systems and types. Also counts toward applied linguistics concentration. Prerequisites: CSCI 251 or permission of instructor."
