		"Modern moral philosophy purports to tell us something about an unethical world - this course explores the gap between the ways that ethics has been discussed in the western philosophical tradition and its persistent failure to account for race, gender, religion, and disability in sensitive ways. Students are introduced to key concepts in moral philosophy and religious studies and use these concepts to consider whether and how modern ethics is worth salvaging."
