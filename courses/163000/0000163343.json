		"Race Matters is a three-course, interdisciplinary learning community for first-year students that focuses on race, ethnicity, and related matters (such as gender, sexuality, class, and religion) in the twenty-first century with a general though not exclusive focus on the United States. The thoroughly integrated curriculum of these three courses bridges the humanities and the social sciences, offering students a deep and broad engagement with race and ethnicity in the contemporary world. This course is the first course in the three-course Race Matters Sequence. All students who commit to this course are also committing to enroll in SOAN 121 during January Term and RAMAT 130 during Spring. RAMAT 110 is offered annually in the fall semester."
