Questions related to employment prospects and standard of living provide an important focus. Classical and Keynesian perspectives are employed in attempting to understand these matters, the macroeconomic problems in market economies and the policies that economists prescribe as remedies for these problems. Offered each semester. Prerequisites: MATH 119 or MATH 120, and ECON 121 or permission of instructor."
