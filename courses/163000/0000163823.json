		"Computational geometry is the study of algorithms for solving geometric problems. This course introduces students to concepts of discrete geometry and their use in geometric algorithms. Topics may include polygons and polyhedra, triangulations, convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and configuration spaces. This course combines both theoretical and computational perspectives, and offers applications to areas such as computer graphics, mesh generation, robotics, and geographic information systems. Offered alternate years during January term. Prerequisites: MATH 242 or MATH 244 or MATH 252 or (MATH 234 and CSCI 221), or instructor permission."
