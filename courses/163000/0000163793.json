		"The field of environmental studies explores how different parts of the Earth system interact with each other, as well as the role that we - as humans - have in shaping our surroundings. In this introductory class, students draw upon a network of scientific, economic, political, and ethical concepts and assemble a toolkit for approaching environmental problems creatively and analytically. Building upon work in the fall EnCon course, students take a deep look at three broad, current environmental issues: climate change, resources, and waste. This course is the second in a three-course Conversation Program. Prerequisite: ENCON 110."
