		"The course investigates issues in health-related settings using a quantitative, research-oriented perspective. Course material focuses on global and public health issues, study design, methods for analyzing health data, and communication of research findings. Design topics include controlled trials, case-control, cohort and other observational studies. Methods include survival analysis and causal inference for observational studies. Communication emphasizes writing up findings and interpreting published research. Also counts toward mathematical biology concentration. Offered alternate years during January term. Prerequisite: completion of SDS 272 or permission of the instructor."
