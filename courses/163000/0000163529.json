		"Students study how a particular religious tradition (or traditions) interacts with a specific topic. Topics vary, but possibilities include the environment, peace and violence, technology, or sexuality. The topic orients students to important questions about how the particular religious tradition understands and acts in the world, as well as debates about what counts as religion. May be repeated if the topic is different."
