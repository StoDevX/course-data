		"From vampires on the big screen to people whose actions, big or small, we call monstrous, we interact with “monsters” every day. How we imagine them and to whom we grant this label says a great deal about us because both acts suggest what we fear most. And this fear regulates our day-to-day behavior. As a way to better understand this complex relationship, this seminar looks at the literary monster; the way the media represents real-life “monsters,” such as the Oklahoma City Bomber; and how horror movies engage in larger cultural conversations. We’ll end with a reflection on the potential for monstrosity in ourselves. Readings will draw from a variety of fields including history, sociology, philosophy, journalism, literature, and creative nonfiction."
