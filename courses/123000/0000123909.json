		"Were the Middle Ages white? Popular culture would often have you think so, depicting a world that is almost completely racialized as white, save for the occasional “exotic” visitor. This seminar course seeks to dispel that image, and assert that the western European Middle Ages was a highly permeable culture whose art was shaped by interactions with cultures in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, whether through trade, the exchange of ideas, or violent conquest."
