		"This seminar challenges students to consider how we hear gender and sexuality. How are norms of masculinity and femininity expressed through music and how have these ideals changed over time? How do musicians and composers communicate sexuality through sound or in performance? Students will investigate the relationships between music, gender and sexuality from a variety of analytical perspectives including music studies, media studies, women and gender studies, and queer theory."
