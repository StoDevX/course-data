		"Students study a particular topic from field(s) in Interdisciplinary Studies. Topics vary from year to year depending on the instructor. Class work depends on the topic and instructor but is consistent with the amount of work in other 200-level ID courses. May be repeated if topics are different. May count toward majors/concentrations if approved by the chair/program director of that major/concentration. Prerequisites: determined by the instructor for each offering."
