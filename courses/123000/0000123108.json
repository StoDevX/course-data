		"The Bible begins with a story about the creation of the material world. It affirms the goodness of material things, of things like bodies, fertility, and food. But it also tasks humans with being responsible for rightly relating to material things, whether one’s own body or creation itself. This course will explore the diverse ways the Bible guides its reader into caring about these materially-rooted relationships. In short, we will read the Bible economically, understanding that economics means “the law of the household” that stresses the importance of just and sustaining practices towards all material things. To do so, we will look at issues such as wealth, sex, farming, gender relations, diet, and private property. We will reflect on the economic concerns of a diverse biblical world rooted in an agrarian economy, tracing the recurrence of themes such as oppression, idolatry, and poverty as problematic features of how humans relate to the material world."
