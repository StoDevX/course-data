		"This elementary introduction to the geometry of four-dimensional Euclidean space begins with an examination of lower-dimensional spaces and their relationships to one another. Generic objects are examined with the goal of understanding how a four-dimensional counterpart might be generated. Students explore what it means to \"see\" four-dimensional objects and in alternative ways. The term ends with group projects realized as a short research paper, a virtual reality show/object, and a class presentation. Offered periodically during Interim. No prerequisite."
