		"This course engages students in scientific inquiry while investigating its broader significance. Students perform experiments from a variety of disciplines to encounter landmark ideas and to investigate the range of quantitative approaches used to proceed from raw data to conclusions. The human ability to recognize patterns and develop models is examined to understand scientific methods and to assess the power, limits, and current status of the natural and behavioral sciences. Offered during Interim. Prerequisite: SCICN 213."
