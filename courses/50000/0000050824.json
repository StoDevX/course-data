		"A survey of fundamental concepts of computer science through an interactive exploration of the Scheme programming language, this course is organized around three approaches to programming: functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming. Topics covered include problem-solving and algorithm development, basic data structures, programming style and documentation, recursion, iteration and loop invariants, elementary algorithm analysis, concepts of object-oriented programming and applications."
