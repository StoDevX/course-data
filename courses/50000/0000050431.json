		"This course helps students explore the connections between society and their own lives. Students answer challenging questions such as Do we have a &human nature'?, Why does social inequality exist?, What is race?, and How do societies change? In answering these questions students will learn to develop a sociological imagination. In doing so they will review the various research methods and theories that form the sociological tradition. Offered Fall and Spring Semesters."
