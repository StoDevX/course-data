		"This course provides a strong foundation in the array of copper plate processes of etching, aquatint, lift ground, soft ground and viscosity color printmaking processes as well as in painterly monoprinting techniques. Students address personal sources of ideas, experimentation, drawing skills and compositional concerns and draw upon examples of master printmakers to discuss how images reflect culture. Critical thinking skills are necessary in discussion and critiques. Prerequisites: Prerequisites: Art 111 and 112 (or 120), and 113. Lab fee. Offered annually."
