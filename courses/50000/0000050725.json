	"desc": "An examination of the development of historically significant conceptions of reality and knowledge. In order to see the historical contribution of philosophy to the self-understanding of Western culture, students study major philosophers from ancient, medieval, and modern Western philosophy, focusing on the ways they have related their explanations of the universe to their conceptions of meaningful human life. Some sections offer a survey of Western philosophy while others stress intensive study of central figures and works. Consult departmental prospectus for details. Open to first-year students and sophomores only.",
