		"Spanning two centuries, from the founding of the colonies to the close of the Civil War, this course begins our discussion of questions central to the entire sequence: What is an American? What does it mean to be free? Students explore the institutions, images and stories of Euro-Americans, African Americans and Native Americans.Topics and texts include the Declaration of Independence and Thomas Jefferson's architecture, the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and the coming of the Civil War."
