		"This course develops and stimulates research into the emotional/expressive properties of art-making in the painting media.

Students learn the importance of process, need for flexibility, how to seek alternatives and how to recognize that a painting has a life of its own. Prerequisites: Art 111 and 112 (or 120), and 113 .
