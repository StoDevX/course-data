		"In this accelerated course in design and drawing, students explore the art elements and their dynamics in composition and experiment with a wide range of media and techniques. Students sharpen their skills in rendering and develop ways to use drawing to convey personal meaning and ideas. Students also study and discuss the technique, content and the context of works by contemporary artists and old masters. This course meets the requirements of 1/2 of the requirements of the foundation program; two additional foundation courses must be taken, one of which must be in three-dimensional studies. Admission to this course is by portfolio review only. Materials fee. Offered Semester I only."
