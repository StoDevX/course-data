	"description": "Students encounter the theory of calculus and tools for communicating ideas with technical accuracy and sophistication. The goal is mastery of the concepts (e.g., limit, continuity, derivatives and integrals) necessary to verify such important proofs as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the continuity of the uniform limit of continuous functions and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem and their context in the theory of analysis. Prerequisite: Mathematics 126 or 128. Offered both semesters.",
