		"Students explore the diverse histories, circumstances and contributions of Latinos in the U.S. by reading essays, news accounts, short fiction and autobiographies, viewing videos and live TV broadcasts, listening to music and so forth. They consolidate their language skills and continue to develop their ability to analyze and communicate in Spanish by writing compositions, making oral presentations and engaging in other interactive group activities. They also review the Spanish verb system and other structures commonly difficult for speakers of English. Prerequisite: Spanish 231 or placement."
