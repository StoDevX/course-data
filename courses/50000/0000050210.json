		"This lab course is highly recommended to enhance the basic biochemistry course and as preparation for further study of biochemistry and related fields. The course introduces students to the process and techniques of biochemistry. Experiments include purification of a protein enzyme and characterization of enzyme activities, kinetics and properties. The course aims to provide continuity in experimentation that is investigative in nature. Significant emphasis is placed upon the development of scientific writing skills. Prerequisite: previous or concurrent registration in Chemistry 379. P/N only. Offered both semesters."
