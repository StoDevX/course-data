		"Students journey toward greater understanding of one of the most wondrous objects in existence - the human body - through an integrated study of the structure of the body (anatomy) and how organs such as the brain, heart and kidney perform their remarkable functions (physiology). The course is designed primarily for students intending careers in the health sciences. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Taught twice a year. Prerequisite: Biology 125."
