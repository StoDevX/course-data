		"What are the natural places you know best, and how have they shaped you? This seminar focuses on writers who narrate a personal experience with nature. We will discuss a range of genres, including creative non-fiction, memoir, and ethnography. We will ask how the natural world shapes individual and community identities, how nature is defined differently in various cultures, and how we can understand ourselves as participants in ecological systems. Students will work on the process of writing in various genres, culminating in a final research paper in which they further investigate a natural place they have experienced and write about its meaning for them."
