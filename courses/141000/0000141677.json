		"As humans, we long for fulfillment and rest. The satiation of these desires focuses on consuming material objects, no matter the environmental consequences. Yet, the biblical tradition calls us to recognize that we are ecological beings. From the way we produce food to the giftedness of the ecosystem, all life is interdependent. This course will attend to this focus, thinking about re-forming our desires through practicing a wholeness grounded in the transcendent gift of creation."
