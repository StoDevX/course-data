		"This course will look at Russian fairy tales and how they have been adapted to film, theater, ballet and opera. All readings and course work will be in English. We will begin by looking at and defining Russian fairy tales within both a folklore and a literary perspective. Then we will look at specific works that have become cultural touchstones in Russia and abroad. Students will explore what made these works popular and how they have been adapted to different audiences throughout the years."
