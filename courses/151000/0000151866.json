		"In this seminar we will explore effective learning techniques by addressing scientific studies, research-based lectures, and essays written by professionals in their fields. The course reinforces these techniques through group projects and collaborative discussions, reflective writings, brief journal entries, informational videos, and guest speakers. Highlighted topics of the course include passive vs. active learning, interleaving as a proven learning strategy, and effective goal-reaching tools. At the end of the term you will more fluently memorize information, give confident and focused presentations, and creative problem-solve. Mastering these techniques enriches our academic, professional, and personal lives."
