		"In this course students use topics in discrete mathematics to engage in problem solving, abstract mathematical thinking, and logical reasoning. Students practice proof writing in multiple contexts, including: propositional and predicate logic; the foundations of set theory, functions, and relations; elementary number theory; arithmetic and geometric progressions; permutations, combinations, and basic probability; and graph theory. Offered each semester. Also counts toward computer science major and management studies concentration. May not be taken after MATH 244 or MATH 252, except with instructor permission. Prerequisite: CSCI 221, MATH 126 or MATH 128."
