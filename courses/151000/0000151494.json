	"description": [
		"This course examines the development of Western philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries, with a focus on the emergence of a distinctively modern sense of self. We look at the liberating, creative forces in this productive period through such thinkers as Descartes, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, Pascal, Spinoza, Leibniz, Lady Masham, Rousseau, and Kant. And we ask: What epistemological and metaphysical commitments about the self and its world have we inherited? What are some of the problematic outcomes of modernity? Offered annually. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy or permission of instructor."
