		"This course combines close study of ancient texts (in English translation) with wide-ranging discussions of literary, historical, and cultural questions. Students have the opportunity to read selections from one or more genres of Greek and/or Latin literature while exploring a topic chosen by the instructor. Analytical writing assignments lead to a deeper understanding of the creative process and encourage thoughtful reflection on the re-creating and repurposing of the original texts by later authors and artists. Offered annually. Counts as an elective and satisfies WIM for Classics, Greek, Latin, and Ancient Studies majors. Prerequisite: WAC (any course satisfying Writing Across the Curriculum) or permission of instructor."
