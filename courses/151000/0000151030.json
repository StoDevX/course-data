		"Students examine current issues in German-speaking societies such as politics, sustainability, social welfare, diversity, and migration. They compare multiple perspectives on, and connections between the issues through sources including documentaries, podcasts, and news articles. Short writing assignments and oral presentations emphasize analysis of texts' strategic organization, argumentative structure, style, and layered voices. Advanced grammar review supports analytical tasks. Taught in German. A weekly small group discussion section led by a native German speaker is required. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward management studies concentration. Prerequisite: GERM 232 or by placement test."
