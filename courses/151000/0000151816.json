		"In this discussion-based course, we will be exploring how power impacts interactions and realities that we see in political systems, pop culture, and even film. Using case studies and personal reflection, we will explore how constructs of power are used differently by different people, and the impact of privilege on power. We will unpack the differences in power for different gender identities, races, and other dimensions of identity, and will develop a strong personal understanding of how we can utilize our own power to pursue goals, lead teams, and make a positive impact on our world and society. To conclude the class, you will pick a film, documentary, or other media, and will analyze the power dynamics that you see."
