		"What does it mean to be an \"emerging adult,\" and what skills can you develop at college to help you thrive after you graduate? How and why do views of young adulthood vary among cultures and families? In this course, you will reflect on adult responsibilities such as fending for yourself, finding a vocation, managing your money, practicing self-care, making independent decisions, being civically engaged, and practicing mindfulness and gratitude. You will explore your own emerging adult identity along with the things that may be holding you back from wanting to, having to, and learning how to be an adult. Assignments will include popular and academic source readings, weekly reflective essays, small and large group discussions, and a service project in Northfield. This class has an ACE component."
