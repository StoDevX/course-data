		"Students learn to design and conduct qualitative research in the tradition of sociological and anthropological ethnography.

Students use their own research to gain experience in interpreting field notes, doing analysis, and writing an ethnographic interpretation of their research findings. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward management studies and public health studies concentrations. Prerequisite: SOAN 291 or SOAN 292; open to junior or senior sociology/anthropology majors only."
