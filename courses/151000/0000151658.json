		"The seminar examines Africans in dispersion/Diaspora as students interrogate the African background of African Americans and links between Africans and African Americans. The course examines the dynamics of precolonial West African societies; the nature of the interaction between Africa and the New World; and the role Africans, African culture, and African institutions played in the political, economic, cultural, and religious life of the New World. Students examine the ties that bind Africans and African Americans and explore questions such as: To what extent was the iconography of Africa used to mobilize Africans in dispersion? How effectively was the consciousness of Africa sustained in the New World? What are the contributions of African Americans to Africa? Also counts toward history, race and ethnic studies, and social studies education majors; and race and ethnic studies concentration."
