		"As they are today, conceptions of sex and gender were hotly debated in early modern Italy. In this seminar, students first explore ideas and debates that shape 21st-century understandings of sex and gender. Then, through an in-depth study of the Roman painter Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1656), students investigate how current understandings of sex and gender shape the study of women artists from the past. Also considered are the responses of contemporary artists (Gina Siciliano and Kehinde Wiley, among others) to Gentileschi's work. Course assignments teach students to engage in meaningful discussion on controversial topics, to visually analyze works of art, and to find and evaluate a variety of sources for individual research projects."
