		"This course explores China across the tumultuous 20th century. Beginning from Qing late imperial China (mid-1800s-1911) through the reform period of the 1980s, students discuss the schools of thought that changed daily life in revolutionary China: fascism, nationalism, anarchism, feminism, socialism, and communism. Through close readings of primary sources in English translation, students investigate what constitutes revolution as a theory and practice in modern China, and how a revolution begins, continues, declines, and rekindles. Offered annually. Also counts toward Asian studies and Chinese majors and Asian studies and management studies concentrations."
