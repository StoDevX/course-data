		"The deepest parts of the oceans are famously unexplored. Only 20% of the ocean has rigorously been measured for depth, discoveries of new deep sea species abound each year, and surveys suggest deep ocean sediments may contain a wealth of untapped natural resources. Why has the deep ocean remained so far from human reach? In this course, we will investigate the challenges of making deep sea observations, the scientific innovations enabling us to access the deepest parts of the ocean, the other-worldly organisms that inhabit deep sea ecosystems, and the potential for human ravaging of these relatively untouched places. We will also pay special attention to the roles of curiosity, risk, failure, and perseverance in exploration - both in ocean exploration specifically and in exploring our own personal spaces. These ideas will be examined by reading and discussing case studies of ocean exploration and analyzing oceanographic data."
