		"This lab course is highly recommended to enhance the study of biochemistry and as preparation for further research in biochemistry and related fields. The course focuses on the isolation, purification, manipulation, and characterization of proteins, DNA, and RNA. The course aims to provide continuity in experimentation that is investigative in nature. Emphasis is placed on the collection, interpretation, and presentation of data. P/N only. Offered each semester. Counts toward neuroscience concentration. Prerequisite: previous or concurrent registration in CHEM 379."
