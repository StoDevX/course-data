		"Students journey toward greater understanding of the human body through an integrated study of the structure of the body (anatomy) and how organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney perform their remarkable functions (physiology). The course is designed primarily for students intending careers in the health sciences. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually. Counts toward exercise science major and neuroscience concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 143, or BIO 150 and BIO 227, or BIO 125, or CH/BI 227."
