Topics include cell structure, metabolism, movement, signaling, and division. The course emphasizes problem-solving, quantitative reasoning, the scientific method, and scientific writing through lectures, discussions, readings, writing assignments, and lab work. Students attend three classe sand one three-hour laboratory each week. Counts toward \"cell biology\" core category for the Biology major. Offered annually in the spring semester.
