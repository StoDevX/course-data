		"Neuroscience is one of the fastest-growing fields in the sciences, with research interests ranging from molecular genetics to whole animal behavior. Topics include membrane biophysics, synaptic transmission and plasticity, intracellular signaling, sensory transduction, motor control systems, and development. Counts toward the biology major. Offered annually, usually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: BIO 143 or CH/BI 227 or BIO 227 or PSYCH 238."
