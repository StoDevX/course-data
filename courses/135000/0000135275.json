		"This topics course focuses on social dancing during a time of social and physical distancing due to COVID 19. Students explore social dance and learn dance forms that do not require dancing with a partner, but rather are typically done in a group setting that does not involve a partner. In addition students will explore the varying ways in which the social dance world has adapted to this time of social distancing and what that can tell us about the nature of \"social dance.\""
