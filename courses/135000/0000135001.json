		"This course examines contemporary China through Chinese-language cinema across different eras, genres, filmmakers, and geographic regions. Students explore the art of film and how visual narratives represent, reinterpret, and redefine Chinese society and culture both at home and abroad. Discussion topics include modernity and tradition, nationalism and globalization, class and race, gender and sexuality, and independent and commercial films. All readings are in English. FLAC component available. Offered periodically. Also counts toward Chinese major and film studies and media studies concentrations."
