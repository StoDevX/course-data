		"The boundaries between the fine arts disciplines of visual art, music, dance, and theater are now seen as completely permeable. This course will allow students to combine visual art making with movement, sound, and performance to create visual spectacle. The course will be organized around a theme or text set each year by the instructor. The course will emphasize process and collaboration and incorporate readings, discussion, critiques, field trips, guest artists, and studio practice. Prerequisites: As least one full credit (or equivalent) in art, dance, music, or theater. Offered occasionally."
