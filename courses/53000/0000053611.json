		"Play is powerful in learning. It is engaging, energizing, and enlightening. This class explores a range of physical activities including Big Ball Work, tumbling, outdoor contouring and terraining, Contact Improvisation, and Capoeira, all in the spirit of play. Each activity develops physical skill, physical confidence, and physical intelligence by developing body organization, strength, and alignment. Investigation into the nature of play as creative process provides a theoretical foundation. Prerequisite: Dance 105, 110, or 111."
