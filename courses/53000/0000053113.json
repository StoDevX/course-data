	"desc": "Chaucer's perennial appeal resides in his ability to dramatize universal ethical problems: the question of human suffering; the need to overcome selfishness, greed, or sin; abusive relationships; tensions between the sexes; the ideal of a good marriage; right relationship with God. Although these ethical questions are framed by a medieval poet, they are clearly of contemporary relevance. Chaucer tackles these ethical issues through a vividly portrayed, if motley, cast of characters who set off on a religious journey and get side tracked (or find their way) through a game of story-telling. The literary approach to ethics -- that is, the study of tales as cases through which we analyze and employ normative approaches to ethical concerns -- is well suited for advanced majors in English or Medieval Studies.",
