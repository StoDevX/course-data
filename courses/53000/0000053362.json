		"This seminar explores research on mental imagery and visual perception, focusing on the use of imagery in thinking. Drawing on both 19th-century empirical studies of visual imagery and contemporary brain scan research, students explore individual differences in mental representations of problem solving and abstract concepts, including numbers, colors, and time. Students also research mental conceptions as represented in dance notation, pictorial instructions, and scientific images. Prerequisites: Psychology 125, 231, and 235 or 237."
