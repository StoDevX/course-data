		"By examining the interaction of people and environment on the North American continent from the 15th century to the present, this course shows how history \"takes place\" in ecological contexts that change over time. Students compare Native American and Euro-American religious beliefs, social values, economic aspirations, and technological developments and examine their consequences for the flora, fauna, and peoples of the continent."
