	"desc": "Sports are more than exercise and entertainment -- they can be understood as social phenomena, related to the social and cultural contexts in which we live. Sports provide stories and images used to explain and evaluate these contexts and provide a window into culture and society. This seminar will consider ways in which sports may be understood as social constructs: who plays sports, what happens to them, and why? Do money and power matter in sports - if so, how? How does \"playing games\" become formalized, institutionalized? What is the role of media in sports? or religion? or government? Students will discuss and produce position papers on various issues relating to sports in society.",
