	"description": "Equatorial Biology offers intensive field-biology experiences within three equatorial New World environments: the Amazon rainforest, the Andean cloud forests, and the Galapagos Islands. Preparation for class requires readings from texts and primary literature concerning evolutionary and ecological biology specific to each region. Three field expeditions alternate with home-base rest days allowing for journaling, readings, assimilation and discussion. Offered during Interim 2003 and in alternate years. Apply through the instructor.",
