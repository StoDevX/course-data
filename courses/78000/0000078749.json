		"The course is based on the Adriatic Coast of Slovenia with travel to Italy, Croatia and Bosnia to students study processes of political identity formation in a part of Europe that has seen the collapse of multi-ethnic empires and the multi-ethnic state of Yugoslavia. Students work in groups representing the concepts used by Charles Tilly to analyze political identity. In group reports, students will construct analytical images of political identities in Piran, Triest, Vukovar, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Mostar."
