		"Having looked at how people journey through Asia, this final semester in Asian Conversations considers how ideas travel over time and space. Students examine a range of interpretations of Asia, including the spiritual, literary, philosophical and linguistics. Students are required to publicly present the ideas gathered from contacts made during Interim at the beginning of the semester. Additional materials include memoirs, novels, and films that share individualized interpretations of Asian journeys. Prerequisite: Chinese 231 or Japanese 231 and Asian Studies 215 or 216. Offered annually in the spring semester."
