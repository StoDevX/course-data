		"Contact Improvisation is a movement form that practices moving through space while sharing one's body weight with another moving person. Students practice movement skills that investigate their relationships with gravity and that increase their physical awareness, their understanding of body structure and function, and their comfort with movement invention. Students research the history of Contact Improvisation and explore its influence in contemporary dance forms. The course builds on skills developed in DANCE 115. Offered alternate years in the spring semester. Prerequisite: DANCE 115."
