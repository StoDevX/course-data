			"desc": "This course takes as its focus the everyday life of men, women, and children in sub-Saharan Africa. Through looking at analytical texts surrounding their experiences, this course will challenge popular images of African crises and international interventions. How are issues as diverse as conflict, poverty, hunger, disease, disablement, migration, reproduction and sexuality lived through the day-to-day experiences of individuals? How do gender, age, class, and ethnicity stratify the forms suffering take? And how do local responses, popular representations, and global political decision-making reflect, contest, and reinforce particular hierarchies of power?",
