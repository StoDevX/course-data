		"This course looks at language as it creates and responds to its cultural and social environments. Students compare and contrast major aspects of language use in Japan and the United States. Students explore the general underlying elements of talk (e.g., standard vs. regional dialects, language attitude and ideologies, politeness, gendered speech patterns, communication styles) and learn to understand how speakers convey subtle meanings, sometimes unconsciously. Knowledge of Japanese is helpful but not necessary. Taught in English. Counts toward linguistic studies and management studies concentrations."
