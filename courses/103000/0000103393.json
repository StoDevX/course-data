		"Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle for independence from colonial rule involved a wide array of nationalist movements. This seminar examines these, including the anti-colonial struggle led by Mohandas Gandhi, who helped forge a long-term movement, centered on the practices of non-violence and civil disobedience, to help bring down the mightiest empire in the world. Course materials include scholarly readings, poetry, films, and music. The course also inculdes a historical role-playing segment."
