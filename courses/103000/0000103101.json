The course is designed primarily for students intending careers in the health sciences. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually. Counts toward exercise science major and neuroscience concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 143, or BIO 150 and BIO 227, or BIO 125, or CH/BI 227.",
