	"desc": "This course explores literature in the context of urban ecology through interdisciplinary readings and activities. Three cities at different moments in history structure the course: ancient Rome, 18th-century London, and contemporary Los Angeles. In each case, students will analyze literary works that portray the city as a matrix of natural and human forces, where water, earth, and the biosphere shape writers' imagined urban landscapes. Genres studied will include poetry, nature writing, memoir, and drama. Counts toward English major. Prerequisite: FYW.",
