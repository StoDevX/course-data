		"Understanding how and why animals behave in certain ways has long been of interest to humans. In this course, we will explore species differences in terms of who mates with whom and who does or does not provide care to offspring in sexually-reproducing animals. In this seminar- style course, we will use primary and secondary scientific literature as a basis for discussions on mating systems and parental care across taxa as well as influential factors such as resource distribution, mate selection and reproductive competition. Students will be involved in leading some and participating in all class discussions. Prerequisite: BIO 150 or its equivalent or permission of instructor."
