		"This course introduces students to the vibrant, interdisciplinary, and growing fields of materials engineering and nanoscale science. Students focus primarily on the relationship between the structure and physical properties of materials, on length scales ranging from millimeters to nanometers. Students research articles from the peer-review literature that highlight the latest developments in the field. Students also discuss the technological and societal impacts of different materials and their applications. Students in this course are normally registered for PHYS 386 as well, in order to complete the requirements for the physics major. Offered annually in the fall semester. Prerequisite: PHYS 374 or PHYS 375."
