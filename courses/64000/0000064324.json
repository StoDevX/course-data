		"This course will focus on the personal essay as a vehicle for exploring our relationships with our past selves, our present world and the mystery that are our futures. This class will therefore privilege questions over answers and discovery by way of digression over orderly defense or what we already think we know. As for style, we will focus on the craft of writing and the criteria that exist for evaluation our own and other's work with regard to personal taste. To assist us we'll read Annie Dillard'sPilgrim of Tinker Creek and undertake -- for the length of the class -- her year-long project of observation and self-revelation."
