		"This seminar explores social change both academically and practically. Through historical analysis, case studies, ethical reflection, and practical application, students investigate local and global social problems contextually and assess a range of approaches to effect change, including community organizing, service projects, public policy, entrepreneurial ventures, and social movements. The seminar integrates a hands-on approach, encouraging students to hone the analytical tools and practical skills needed to cultivate change and engage fully as citizens."
