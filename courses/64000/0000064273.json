Additional course material focuses on global public health issues and methods for analyzing health data. Students work on projects with researchers from the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, where they learn about the global burden of disease and how statisticians and epidemiologists can contribute to finding solutions. Students have the opportunity to tour the WHO facility, meet WHO researchers and learn about the work of statisticians and epidemiologists there. A visit to the International Cancer Research Centre (IARC) in Lyon, France provides an international perspective of issues associated with cancer research.
