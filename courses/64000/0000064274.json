	"description": "This study of chemical stoichiometry, equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, coordination chemistry and atomic and molecular structure supplies the fundamental background on which all later chemistry courses depend. It includes applications of equilibrium principles to acid-base chemistry. Students attend three classes and one 3-hour laboratory each week. Prerequisites: high school chemistry and physics and concurrent registration in Mathematics 120 or 121. The course cannot be taken in conjunction with or after credit in Chemistry 121. Offered Fall Semester.",
