		"This course explores use of computational techniques to understand reaction pathways. Students use computers to perform energy minimization and molecular orbital calculations on molecules taken primarily from, but not limited to, the realm of organic chemistry. Application of concepts such as kinetics, stereochemistry, and acid-base chemistry in relation to understanding reaction mechanisms is an important part of the course. Prerequisites: Chemistry 248 and 371 or permission of instructor. Offered Spring Semester of 2007 and alternate years thereafter."
