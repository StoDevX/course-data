		"How do people understand illness and healing? How does social inequality shape our health? These are among the questions explored by medical anthropology. In this course we will examine the ways people in different societies experience their bodies, by looking at AIDS in Haiti, old age in India, and childbirth in the United States. We will investigate diverse understandings of health, different means of promoting healing, and the role of power in providing medical care. Prerequisite: one Sociology/Anthropology course. Offered Fall or Spring Semester."
