		"This course introduces students to the art and craft of writing for stage and screen. As a workshop, the course encourages students to work out unique solutions to the aesthetic and practical challenges confronting dramatic writers of a one act play or short screenplay in light of historical, theoretical, and critical materials. The course emphasizes the technical elements of dramatic writing, the vocabulary of the writer, and the nature of the writing experience, from germinal idea to marketing the completed script. Prerequisite: Theatre 110 or permission of instructor."
