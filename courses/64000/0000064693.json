		"This introductory survey course builds students' visual literacy skills (how to read a film). For each region explored cinematically -- Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa -- students study a classic film text (for a survey of twentieth-century film history), as well as a contemporary film. Both classic and contemporary films will explore the ways films negotiate the values of their respective societies, contributing to national history and identity; and reflect the modern phenomenon of globalization, via the trans-national language of cinema."
