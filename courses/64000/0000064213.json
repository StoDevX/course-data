		"What is the role of language in our society? What is the impact of bilingualism in the U.S.? Students explore such questions from current Spanish socio-linguistics research. Through analysis of data, students examine issues of language contact, variation and change, language and gender, language and power, and/or language planning. Students may register more than once provided a different topic is offered. This course includes the study of at least one substantive literary work. Taught in Spanish. Prerequisites: Spanish 250 and 276."
