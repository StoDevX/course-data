		"This course familiarizes students with the social and political forces characterizing contemporary Japan, the world's second most powerful economy and a leading example of a successful liberal democracy. Students examine how Japanese citizens, interest groups, bureaucrats, and politicians are negotiating issues related to economic prosperity, the aging of their society, inequality, globalization, and international affairs. Students also consider major features of Japan's democracy -- governmental structures, electoral procedures, and political history. Recommended: One previous course in political science or Asian Studies."
