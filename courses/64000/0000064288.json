		"This course will focus on the craft of writing, since such a focus provides clear criteria for evaluating our own and others' work without regard to personal taste. Further, this course is about first drafts and the revisions that follow, about process rather than product. (It is, in fact, this courses's view that product is merely a residue that the creative process leaves behind.) Finally, because we have a very short time to look at and try out a lot of different things, our prose writing will focus on very short works: micro-fiction, descriptions, character sketches, brief scenes, moments of dialogue."
