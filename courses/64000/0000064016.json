His De Rerum Natura (\"On the Nature of the Universe\") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating poem. Prerequisite: Latin 231 or equivalent. Offered every third year."
