		"This seminar seeks an ethical framework for developing health policies with significant population and individual impacts. Which perspective should be taken - that of the population or the individual? When and how might the interests of each balance, trump, or constrain the interests of the other? Students explore substantive and procedural approaches to \"fairness\" when population interests compete with or compromise individuals' pursuit of the good as they see it, and consider the challenges of a severe, 1918-type influenza pandemic."
