Students will read and respond critically to a range of writing that may include textbook chapters, popular feature stories, and creative literature. Readings in Summer 2008 may include general interest articles from American Scientist, Smithsonian Magazine, and Natural History, poems about science, math, nature, health, and wellness, short essays from The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2007, and biographies or real life adventure (The Beak of the Finch or Mountains Beyond Mountains), and even novels (An Imperfect Lens). The course emphasizes how writers use common rhetorical strategies, such as narrating, making and supporting claims, and integrating research to communicate effectively in a variety of genres for multiple audiences.",
