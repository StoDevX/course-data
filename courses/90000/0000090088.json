		"Students explore aspects of chemistry that are encountered in the world. Basic concepts in chemistry, such as matter and bonding, acid/base chemistry, and solution chemistry, are discussed within the context of society at large. Laboratory experiences complement the class material, and students have opportunities to explore chemistry principles. Students attend three hours of class and one three-hour laboratory per week. Does not count toward the major. Offered annually in the spring semester."
