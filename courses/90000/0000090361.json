Lectures in this core course cover ideas and technologies contributing to understanding mechanisms of gene transmission and regulation. Laboratories utilize model organisms to investigate classical and molecular modes of inheritance. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 150, and Chemistry 125 or 121/123 or Chemistry/Biology 125; or Biology 125 and Chemistry 125 or 121/123 or Chemistry/Biology 125. Counts as \"genetics\" core category.
