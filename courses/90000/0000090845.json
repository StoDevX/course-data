		"Research clearly shows that labeling isolated sentence components with grammatical terms, drilling workbook exercises, and diagramming sentences are ineffective classroom practices. What can teachers do to help their students gain mastery of standard written English? In this half-credit course, students explore both the theory and practice of contextual grammar instruction. Students also hone their own grammatical knowledge, applying their new knowledge of both content and pedagogy through in-class micro-teachings. Offered annually in the second half of the spring semester."
