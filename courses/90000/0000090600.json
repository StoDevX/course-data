		"Students further develop artistic, athletic technical skills in modern dance through concentrated work on movement sequencing and dance conditioning. Students learn, create, and perform movement patterns rich in attention toward actions and alignments of the spine, spatial pathways, dynamics of time and energy, expression of weight/gravity, and intricate foot and legwork. Prerequisite: Two terms of Dance 111 or permission of instructor. Open to dance majors and other students with permission of instructor. Dance 251 may be repeated with permission of instructor. Offered spring semester."
