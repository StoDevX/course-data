	"description": [
		"Rather than focus on a region or period of time, we will look at how historians from many different fields explore and understand \"everyday life.\" What do historians have to say about eating, work, rumors, fear, night, noise, bingo, and more? What sources do they use for this research? What significance do we find in these histories of everyday life? Much of this study is defined by changes in social and cultural history, with an emphasis on local and micro-histories. Students will produce a substantial research paper, based on primary sources and focused on a theme or problem related to histories of everyday life. Seniors are welcome. Juniors especially are encouraged to consider this course, especially those considering academic internships, participation in the summer undergraduate research program, or distinction."
