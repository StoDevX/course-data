Students learn to assess needs and progress, design case interventions, measure client satisfaction, and assess program outcomes. They evaluate elements of practice with diverse clients and portions of programs with which they are familiar and apply ethical standards to scientific inquiry. Open only to social work majors. Offered annually in the spring semester."
