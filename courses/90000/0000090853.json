Through a study of landmark works from the 17th to the 20th century, students develop and practice listening techniques that sharpen critical perception and open the door to a fuller enjoyment of the musical arts. The ability to read musical scores is helpful but not required. Activity fee. Offered annually in the spring semester.",
