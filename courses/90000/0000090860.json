		"Fourth-semester music majors continue formal musicianship studies. Students analyze and compose Western art music in styles from 1875 to the present, including late-nineteenth-century chromaticism, serialism and set theory, impressionism and neoclassicism, and blues and jazz styles. Performance and dictation studies follow these topics closely, including an introduction to jazz improvisation. Prerequisite: Music 212. Offered annually in the spring semester."
