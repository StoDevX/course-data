Examining the origin and evolution of vertebrates, comparing morphology across vertebrate taxa and examining selective factors leading to modern forms is of value to health science students, graduate studies in biology, and people who like dinosaurs. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 150, or Biology 125 and 126, or Chemistry/Biology 125-227 and Biology 126. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category.",
