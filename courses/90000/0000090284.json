	"description": [
		"Students journey toward greater understanding of the human body through an integrated study of the structure of the body (anatomy) and how organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney perform their remarkable functions (physiology). The course is designed primarily for students intending careers in the health sciences. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisite: Biology 143, or Biology 150 and 227, or Biology 125, or Chemistry/Biology 125-227. Offered annually. Counts towards exercise science major and neuroscience concentration."
