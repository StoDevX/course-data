	"description": [
		"In this course, students read a series of memoirs to investigate the way Christianity has shaped individual people. From snake-handling to baptism, from icon-kissing to communion, from creeds to purity promises, Christian beliefs and practices can, by turns, prove to be life-giving, oppressive, disturbing, and salvific. How does emphasizing differing aspects of theology result in differing attitudes toward sexuality, gender, race, and the environment? In addition to approaching the memoirs from a critical perspective, students also identify and practice craft techniques as they write their own personal religious (or areligious) narratives. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
