This 0.25 course can satisfy the Active Body graduation requirement. Only one 0.25 intercollegiate athletics course credit can be applied toward the 35.00 credits required for graduation. Fall: varsity football, soccer, cross-country, women's volleyball; spring: remainder of intercollegiate sports. Participants in club sports are not eligible for academic credit. Students must register for the course during the competitive season, not afterward."
