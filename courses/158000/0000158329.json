		"First-semester music majors begin formal musicianship studies. Students perform rhythms and melodies at sight. Students also analyze and compose Western tonal music that employs non-dominant seventh chords, applied chords, sequences, modulations, and small forms. These topics are closely integrated into melodic and harmonic dictations. Class meets four times weekly. Offered annually. Prerequisite: MUSIC 112. Concurrent registration in MUSIC 162 is strongly encouraged."
