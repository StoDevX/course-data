		"How similar or different is the conception of God that Christians and Muslims speak of, pray to, and worship? Christianity and Islam share scriptural and intellectual resources and complicated histories full of both cooperation and conflict. Exploring these topics, students analyze and compare theological emphases, reflect on how much similarity and difference there has been between the two traditions of reflection, and examine possibilities for future interaction. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward Middle Eastern studies concentration."
