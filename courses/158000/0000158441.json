		"How is academic work in Race and Ethnic Studies enabled or transformed by an openness to creativity? And how is creative work--in fields such as film, music, literature, and visual art--enabled or transformed by research? In this seminar, students encounter foundational and contemporary work that addresses one or both of these questions. In the second half of the semester, students pursue individual projects (academic, creative, or both) that serve as their response. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: Enrollment by approval of instructor."
