		"In this course, students disrupt, transform, and create things and ideas to practice and apply innovative thinking. Improvisation, role playing, and creativity exercises prompt music, spoken word, dance and physical movement, writing, drawing, painting, and basic building to initiate problem solving. In addition, students read and write about creativity theory to guide their practice. Students collaborate to design their learning space, to engage with the local community, and to work with guest instructors. Offered annually in the fall semester."
