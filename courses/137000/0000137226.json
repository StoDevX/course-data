		"New capabilities in digitization have radically changed the way people understand and interact with history. In this seminar, students survey new digital tools in data visualization, curation, and presentation available to the historian. They experiment with these tools to craft compelling scholarly arguments which can be showcased online for historians and non-historians alike. Students produce a major digital research project using historical documents from online archives and St. Olaf College Archives and Libraries Special Collections. Offered in alternate years."
