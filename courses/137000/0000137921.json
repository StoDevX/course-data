		"Students examine how humans learn language as well as how they learn more than one language, as is the case for the vast majority of people. Students also explore the factors that enable or hinder language learning and whether bilinguals are smarter. These are just some of the fascinating issues addressed in the course that combines study of theory, fieldwork-based analysis of learner language, and pedagogical considerations, including a focus on both English and World Langauge learners. Offered annually in the fall semester. Required for ESL licensure and TEFL certificate. Also counts toward linguistic studies concentration. Prerequisite: FYW."
