		"Drawing the human form from life has been a mainstay in the training of artists since the Renaissance because of its unparalleled discipline in the training of the eye. Along with becoming better observers, students reach a personal understanding of the figure and an appreciation of its art-historical uses. Various media and techniques are explored as a means to understand the expressive possibilities of the figure. Materials fee. Offered alternate years. Prerequisite: ART 102."
