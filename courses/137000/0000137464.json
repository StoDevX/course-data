		"Students explore life in the German-speaking countries through reading, discussing, and retelling narrative texts. The course emphasizes vocabulary building, a thorough review of German grammar, and the composition of short narratives to develop writing skills for paragraph-length discourse. Taught in German with some grammar explanations in English. Offered annually in the fall semester. May count toward the German major but not the German studies concentration. Prerequisite: GERM 112 or by placement test."
