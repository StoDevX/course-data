		"This course focuses on key mechanisms used in attempts to transfer, institutionalize and consolidate political power in Latin America, specifically: revolution and armed revolt, the creation of authoritarian and military regimes, transitions to democracy and creation of new economic structures. Using theory, historical fictional and factual accounts, students look for the human ramifications of these dramatic changes as well as exploring their nature and origins. Prerequisites: Political Science 112 and a course on Latin America. Offered periodically."
