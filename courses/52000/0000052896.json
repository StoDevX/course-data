		"The idea of evolution forms the foundation for all modern biological thought. This course will examine the processes of evolution in detail (selection, genetic drift, mutation, migration) and study the methods by which biologists reconstruct the history of life on the planet. Advanced topics will be explored through reading and discussion of journal articles. The social and historical context of evolutionary theory will be discussed. GE: ORC. Prerequisites: Biology 125, 126, and 233 . Offered annually."
