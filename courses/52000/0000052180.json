Students develop an advanced understanding of these methods by application of various methods to works of art, by examining historical factors surrounding principle movements in the study of art history and by engaging in lively class debates about them. Readings, discussions and presentations culminate in an independent research project that allows each student to find his or her own place in the discipline. Prerequisite: two upper division courses in art history.",
