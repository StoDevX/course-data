	"desc": "Neuroscience is one of the fastest growing fields, with activity ranging from the fundamentals of behavior to molecular aspects of neuronal function. This course provides a foundation and overview of the important and extensive ways in which biological and physiological processes are involved in the regulation and maintenance of behavior. Among the topics students explore are: fundamental electrophysiology, sensory and motor systems, integration, learning and memory and the mind-body connection. Prerequisites: Biology 125, or Chemistry 121 (or 125), or Physics 126, or Psychology 125. Biology 125 is strongly recommended. Counts toward major: Biology, Psychology.",
