		"Students examine the Renaissance's return to classical values and the Reformation's return to early Christian attitudes which challenge the authority of the medieval synthesis. Students trace the development of new sources of authority including the new science with its influence on art, literature, politics and philosophy. Discussions consider Luther, Calvin, Descartes, Locke, Milton, Aphra Behn, Voltaire, Rousseau, Goethe, Teresa of Avila, Wollstonecraft and the artistry of Michaelangelo, Caravaggio, Bach and Shakespeare."
