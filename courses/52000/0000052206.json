	"description": "Southeast Asia is a diverse region, stretching from the sleek high-rises of Singapore to hermetic Rangoon; from Islam to Buddhism; from computer chip manufacture to swidden agriculture. Students read ethnographies, novels and local histories to better understand Southeast Asian family life, religion, language and education. Through focusing on the experience of modernity, Students examine how Southeast Asians make sense of their group affiliations, their pasts and their futures. The course aims to challenge contemporary understandings of place, entitlement and home both in Southeast Asia and beyond.",
