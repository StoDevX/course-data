		"This seminar-style course develops students' abilities to reflect on Americans' encounters with their landscape traditions. We study ways Americans have built on the land and have worshipped and represented nature in paintings, photographs and advertisements. Students will learn to read landscapes, to discover how important artistically, religiously and ecologically the landscape tradition has been in the Unites States, and to become thoughtful viewers and creators of landscapes. Counts toward major: Art, Art History and Environmental Studies. Counts toward concentration: American Studies, Environmental Studies."
