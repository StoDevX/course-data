Examples are drawn from ancient Athens, medieval Christendom, Asia, Islam and the modern West; ethical topics include: pacifism, utilitarianism, divine command ethics, natural law theory, feminism and cultural relativism. The course begins with warfare as treated in the Bible and concludes with nuclear terrorism."
