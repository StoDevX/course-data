	"description": "Drawing the human form from life has been a mainstay in the training of artists since the Renaissance because of its unparalleled discipline in the training of the eye. Along with becoming better observers, students reach a personal understanding of the figure and an appreciation of its art historical uses. Various media and techniques are explored as a means to understand the expressive possibilities of the figure. Prerequisites: Art 111 and 112 (or 120), and 113. Offered annually.",
