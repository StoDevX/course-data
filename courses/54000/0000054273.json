	"desc": "This course explores the art created in Western Europe from 1140-1400 and the revival of the Gothic style in nineteenth-century and twentieth-century Europe and America. The course addresses the rise of the medieval city, the importance of the Cathedral, and ways that new forms of spirituality gave rise to new styles of pictorial arts and architecture. The course ends with a discussion of what Gothic art came to symbolize for people in the centuries after its origins. The course will consist of class discussions, short quizzes, writing assignments and required field trips. A course lab fee will cover the cost of a course reader and the field trips.",
