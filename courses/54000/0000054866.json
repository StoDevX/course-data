		"This course explores the origins of the modern Russian empire. Using primary sources such as chronicles, folktales, legal codes, letters, and religious icons, students consider Russia's development from a loose collection of princedoms to a powerful, multi-ethnic empire spanning 11 time zones. Topics include the impact of geography and climate, the Orthodox religion, Mongol rule, gender roles, the rise of autocracy, and social rebellion. Taught frequently."
