		"Students embark on an exploration of pedestrian and religious ritual movement and concert dance in Middle Eastern, Asian and American cultures to increase intercultural sensitivity and competence. The emphasis is on discovering how movement and dance express and communicate cultural values, as well as developing the skills to perceive, describe, interpret and evaluate movement. Includes studio, classroom and field experiences. A ticket/transportation fee is required for trips to performances in the Twin Cities."
