		"This seminar examines the mutual influences of science and society while exploring the historical, political, economic, and religious aspects of these influences. Through course reading and in-class discussions, we will examine the institutional settings that shape the practices of science and the vocation of scientists. We will analyze how social and theological perspectives may at times resist and advance science, sometimes in unexpected ways. Through in-class discussions, research, and writing assignments, students will analyze how science shapes and is shaped by its social contexts, discuss the methods that natural and social sciences use to examine phenomena, and interrogate the very nature of science itself. Together, we will explore how science and theology affect each other as they shape reflection upon the origin, nature, and destiny of human life and the cosmos."
