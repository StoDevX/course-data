	"desc": "Students read fiction, drama, poetry, and literary journalism in which sport plays an integral role. By focusing on this intersection between sports and literature, students develop a richer understanding of the ways in which literary texts critique and re-imagine popular culture. In addition to analyzing and interpreting literary texts, students develop their own critiques of comtemporary sports culture. Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. Offered periodically.",
