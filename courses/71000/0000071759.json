		"This course introduces students to the study of racism and sexism from a variety of disciplinary perspectives with special attention to the impact on women and on African-American and Latino families. Students examine the processes by which race and gender are socially constructed to benefit some and disadvantage others. Students consider how prejudice develops and learn strategies to communicate with people of diverse backgrounds."
