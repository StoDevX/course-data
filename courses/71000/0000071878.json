		"This course focuses on a single novel: John Fowles's 1969 The French Lieutenant's Woman, a bestseller that's also highly allusive postmodernist classic. After reading Fowles's novel, we will spend the term following up on its many references to and relationships with other texts - leading us to a wide range of writers and artists including Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Thomas Hardy, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Roland Barthes, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Hayden White, and Harold Pinter (who wrote the rather quirky 1981 film adaptation of the novel). Returning to The French Lieutenant's Woman after exploring this larger context of history, fiction, art, criticism, and theory, we will ask: What difference does this body of knowledge make in our experience of the novel? How does intertextuality - a text's network of relationships with other texts - work? We will also consider postmodernism and its take on history and intertextuality, ideas about the 'ideal reader' or 'implied audience,' sex and sexuality in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, and a deep twentieth-century fascination with the Victorian era. Pre-requisite: GE 111 or its equivalent."
