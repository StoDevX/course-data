		"Veselica International Dance Ensemble introduces student performers and audiences to dance as a global art, expanding their awareness of the spectrum of dance forms and contexts in the world. Student performers develop skills by performing a variety of dance forms and experience the process of working together in an ensemble to create quality performances. Interested students can choreograph or stage international dance works, and members of the ensemble may also work with guest choreographers. The ensemble is open by audition to all students. May be repeated. P/N only."
