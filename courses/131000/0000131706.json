		"This interdisciplinary course explores the timeless concept of the hero from both Asian and Western traditions. Classical heroes will be analyzed along with those featured in contemporary films, fictions, comics, and pop culture. The main goal is to compare and examine how heroes have informed intellectual, artistic, and moral traditions in various cultures and how heroic ideas were spread, transformed, and re-imagined to suit the needs of their times. Offered periodically. Also counts toward Chinese and Japanese majors."
