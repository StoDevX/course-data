		"This course investigates the human relationship with the natural world, examining ways in which the natural environment is important psychologically to human beings. Integrating aspects of theoretical and empirical psychology, environmental studies and literature, we explore meanings, values, and questions such as: How are we affected by nature? What affects people's attitudes and behaviors toward the environment? How do we respond to environmental challenges? How does the field of psychology address the natural world? Offered periodically during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Also counts toward environmental studies major (all emphases) and concentration. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125 or ENVST 137."
