		"Students explore the diverse cultural histories and identities of Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Puerto Ricans (among other Latinx groups) by considering how ethnicity, race, language, gender, and social class manifest themselves in U.S. histories of citizenry, immigration, economy, and education through generations of Latinxs. Class activities foster analysis of historical and autobiographical texts to reflect on how power and privilege intersect and shape students' own experiences. Attendance at cultural events required. This intermediate II-level Spanish course is offered every semester and during Interim. Does not count toward Spanish major. Prerequisite: SPAN 231 or placement."
