		"Sample Topic: The Psychology of Good and Evil",
		"Why do we feel it is important to judge behavior as morally good or bad? How do we make these judgments? What makes it possible for people to commit acts of extraordinary heroism or evil? Good answers to these questions require knowledge of philosophical and theological ethics and of the empirical work on moral action and judgment. Students read both and ask how they do (and should) inform each other. Prerequisite: PSYCH 230 and at least two level II psychology courses, or permission of the instructor."
