		"Through exploring the material and human diversity of the Spanish-speaking world and important connections among the United States, the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, and Spain, students develop increasingly complex skills for analyzing and communicating in Spanish. An examination of geography, environmental challenges and solutions, development, demographic changes, and ethnic diversity highlights the intersection of cultural, economic, and environmental realities. Required attendance at three conversation tables. This intermediate I-level Spanish course is offered each semester and during Interim. Does not count toward Spanish major. Prerequisite: SPAN 112 or placement into SPAN 231."
