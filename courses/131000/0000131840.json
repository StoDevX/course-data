		"This course, a continuation of CHEM 121, examines atomic and molecular structure, including classical and quantum theories, bonding models, molecular orbitals and coordination chemistry. CHEM 121 and CHEM 123 together are equivalent in content to CHEM 125 and are designed to prepare students for CHEM 126. Offered during Interim. Also counts toward biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisite: CHEM 121."
