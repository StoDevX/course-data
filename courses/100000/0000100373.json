		"This course provides a strong foundation in the array of copper plate processes of etching, aquatint, lift ground, soft ground, and polymer plate printmaking processes as wellas in painterly monoprinting techniques. Students address personal sources of ideas, experimentation, drawing skills and compositional concerns and draw upon examples of master printmakers to discuss how images reflect culture. Critical thinking skills are necessary in discussion and critiques. Materials fee. Offered annually. Prerequisite: ART 102."
