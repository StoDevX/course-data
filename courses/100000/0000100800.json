		"Students are exposed to healthcare careers while they examine the science of health and wellness in relation to self-care, stress-management, sleep, rest, and nutrition. Students learn about physiological biochemical responses to stress, grief, and loss as well as the mechanisms of coping. Students use medical terminology in therapeutic communication and explore values and ethics for collaborative interprofessional practice. An overview of the healthcare system, holistic care, and evidence-based practice is provided. Counts toward nursing and exercise science majors. Offered during interim."
