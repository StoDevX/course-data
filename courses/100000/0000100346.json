		"Play is powerful in learning and creating. It engages, energizes, and enlightens. This class explores a range of physical activities designed to develop physical skill, confidence, and intelligence--all in the spirit of play. It incorporates activities for developing body organization and alignment while challenging students' imagination and creative sensibilities. Tumbling, terraining, contact improvisation, and ball play represent a few of the included activities. P/N only. Offered annually in the fall semester."
