Students discover how chemistry intersects with everyday living, especially the abilities and limitations of science to address environmental issues. Laboratory work explores the characteristics and analysis of hazardous and beneficial materials. Counts toward environmental studies major (arts and humanities and social science emphases) and concentration; does not count toward chemistry major. Offered during Interim.",
