Students purify the materials they produce by techniques such as chromatography and characterize them using optical rotation measurements, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Students attend one three-hour laboratory each week. P/N only. Offered annually in the fall semester. Counts toward biomolecular science concentration.
