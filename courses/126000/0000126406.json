		"Students learn to create improvised solos based on standard jazz practice from different historical eras. To internalize the styles of jazz masters from different time periods, participants transcribe recorded jazz solos by ear and perform them in class. Students gain appreciation of and experience with different harmonic and scalar conceptions through performing and analyzing selected jazz solos. Open to instrumentalists and vocalists. Offered annually in the spring semester."
