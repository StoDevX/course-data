		"In this intermediate photography course, students explore a variety of techniques and topics. Techniques include historic processes such as cyanotype and salted paper printing, digital photography, large-scale color printing, and traditional black and white photography.

This course includes field trips, readings, discussion, and visual presentations. Materials fee. Offered annually. Counts toward media studies concentration. Prerequisite: ART 104 or ART 205, or permission of instructor."
