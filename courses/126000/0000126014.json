At the same time, the course attends to the economic, religious, political, and social forces that have affected the development of dance in the United States. No dance experience required. Ticket/transportation fee required. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts toward race and ethnic studies, American studies, and women's and gender studies majors and race and ethnic studies and women's and gender studies concentrations."
