		"This course explores linguistic and social processes that underlie language change with a focus on the Germanic language family. Students learn the fundamental methods of comparative historical linguistics to analyze the development of modern Germanic languages (e.g., English, German, Norwegian, etc.) from a common ancestor. These processes concern how language operates as a cognitive system, as well as core social factors that impact language practices. Students also learn to critically engage with linguistic scholarship and develop their research and writing skills through a project on a topic of their choosing. Offered periodically."
