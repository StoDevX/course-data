	"description": [
		"Religion has played a crucial role in most major issues of American politics ranging from slavery, civil rights, prohibition, the criticism of capitalism, the affirmation of capitalism, abortion, same-sex marriage and the very place of religion in our public life. This course examines the ways in which religion and politics intersect in public opinion, campaigns, public policy, lobbying, court cases, political rhetoric, and the broader principles of American political culture. Looking at both quantitative and qualitative evidence, the course explores different theoretical explanations of the role of religion in American politics. Offered alternate years. Prerequisite: One course in PSCI."
