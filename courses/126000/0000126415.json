		"Through autobiographies and other texts, students explore the unique histories and identities of Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and Puerto Ricans, among others. By considering how ethnicity, race, gender, and social class manifest themselves in U.S. institutions such as immigration policy, citizenship, and the educational system for different groups of Latinos, students will reflect on how power and privilege intersect to shape their own experiences.Attendance at four cultural events required. This Intermediate II-level Spanish course is offered each semester and during Interim. Prerequisite: SPAN 231 or placement into SPAN 232."
