	"desc": "In this course, students will examine how schools and communities in the Twin Cities interact to provide support and developmental opportunities for school-age children. Through lectures, readings, discussions, field trips and in-school and co-curricular placements, students gain an understanding and awareness of how race, class, ethnicity, national origin, and gender shape the complex character of urban youth and schools. Students will spend one week in orientation activities on campus and two weeks in the Twin Cities. During the time in the Twin Cities, St. Olaf students will participate as tutors and classroom assistants during the school day and then assist in various after-school and community programs. The last week of Interim will be spent back on campus discussing the experience. Counts toward major: ARMS. Fulfills Education 382: Human Relations requirement. Counts toward concentration: ARMS.
