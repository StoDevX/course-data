	"description": "What happened to the dinosaurs? Can some human congenital heart defects be explained by reference to cardiovascular systems of diving turtles? Examining the origin and evolution of vertebrates, comparing morphology across vertebrate taxa and examining selective factors leading to modern forms is of value to health science students, graduate studies in biology, and people who like dinosaurs. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: Biology 125 and 126, or Chemistry/Biology 125, 126, 127 and Biology 126.",
