		"This course explores the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people from several social science perspectives. We'll look at whether gender and sexual orientation (both heterosexual and homosexual) are socially constructed or biologically natural, and what cross-cultural and historical examples can tell us. We'll look at controversies over the family and religious status of GLBT people, why homosexuality has become such a political issue, and movements for change. Offered during Interim."
