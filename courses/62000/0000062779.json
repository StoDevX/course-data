	"desc": "Students trace and integrate the African-American and Euro-American dance traditions of the late 19th and 20th centuries and early 21st century, paying attention to their similarities and differences. The focus is on the theatrical dance genres of ballet, modern, and musical theater dance. Students also examine social dance as the predecessor of some theatrical dance genres. At the same time, the course attends to the economic, religious and social forces which have affected the development of dance in America. Extensive video examples supplement reading, writing and discussion. A ticket/transportation fee is required for performances. Prerequisite: Dance 100. Offered Spring Semester.",
