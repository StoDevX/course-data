		"This course is designed to provide practical experiences for students to explore career opportunities in education and classroom teaching. Following an on-campus introduction to American elementary and secondary education, students will participate in observational and practical experiences at in-school settings, serving as a teacher aide and paraprofessional with a selected teacher/mentor. Closely involved in the life of the school and with the teaching staff, students will gain insight into teaching and schooling. Assessment, reading assignments and journals will complement the experience. Prerequisite: Apply through department of education by Oct. 15, priority given to second-year students."
