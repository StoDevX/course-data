Kamehameha, in Honolulu, is an affluent, urban, private, Hawaiian cultural immersion school. The Kailua Kona schools, on the big island, are rural, public, mixed-race environments. Students discover the challenges and benefits associated with teaching in a diverse racial, cultural and socio-economic environments. Through guest lectures, readings, field trips and seminars, students learn about the truly unique geographic and cultural setting of the Hawaiian islands. This environment makes an excellent framework to examine diversity on the mainland. Counts toward major: ARMS. Counts toward concentration: ARMS. Fulfills Education 382: Human Relations requirement.
