		"In this course, students travel to Shanghai, China. They consider how direct experience provides them with their own narratives about people, places, and culture of China. Through attention to their own structured and unstructured experiences during the course, students better understand how ordinary people construct \"Chinese\" and \"Asian\" culture and society today. Through multifaceted engagement with Shanghai and other sites students may visit during their stay, they analyze the role representation and narrative play in both their encounter with and study of Asia. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Also counts toward the Chinese major. Prerequisites: at least one Chinese language course."
