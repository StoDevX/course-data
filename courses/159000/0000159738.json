		"This course examines the historical roots of modern culture and institutions from the earliest records of the Ancient Middle East and Mediterranean to Medieval Europe. Through a multi-disciplinary approach, students analyze the evolution of ubiquitous modern systems such as base-6 time keeping (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day), trial by jury, \"school\" and the liberal arts university, \"money,\" slavery, democracy, republic, monarchy and settler colonialism and imperialism. Offered annually. Also counts toward ancient studies and medieval studies majors."
