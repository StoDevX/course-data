		"This course investigates intersections of faith, culture, and politics in Scandinavian and Islamic communities. Students study early encounters between Islamic and Nordic societies and the history of migration to Norway, Denmark, and Sweden from traditionally Islamic countries. Students will examine the cultural challenges faced by Muslims, in particular women, media representations of the Muslim community in politics and society, and extreme reactions that have arisen in the face of multi-religious communities in Scandinavia. Offered alternate years. Also counts toward Norwegian major."
