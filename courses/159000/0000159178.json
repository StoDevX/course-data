		"How do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning process? While some emphasis is on analysis of the behavioral viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students also examine the ways current investigators apply these basic principles to problems in other fields. These include behavioral therapy for a variety of psychological disturbances, research on the neurobiology of drug reward, and analysis of consumer behavior. Students engage in hands-on activities as a part of the class to enhance their learning. Offered annually. Also counts toward neuroscience, educational studies and business and management studies concentrations. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125."
