		"Using literature as the primary lens, this course studies soccer as a unique phenomenon with deep roots in British society, paying particular attention to the sport's historical, social, cultural, and aesthetic aspects. While in England, students attend matches, stadium tours, and speak with supporters' organizations from the Premier League to the lower divisions. Students think about how soccer informs other aspects of British culture, and how British society finds its way into England's most popular game. Offered alternate years in January term. Prerequisite: FYS and WRR."
