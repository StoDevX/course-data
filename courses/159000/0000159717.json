		"This course offers an engaging exploration into the field of museum studies with a particular emphasis on social justice principles and practices. Museums serve as vital institutions in society, shaping narratives, preserving cultural heritage, and reflecting the values of communities. However, traditional museum practices have often perpetuated exclusionary narratives and overlooked marginalized voices. This course examines these issues critically and explores strategies for creating more inclusive and equitable museum spaces."
