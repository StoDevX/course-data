		"This course explores tensions between mythical worldviews-in which traditional stories explain things-and rational worldviews-which find explanations in universal laws. Students witness the decline of myth in Greek epics, tragedies, and philosophy. They discover related patterns in Old Testament writings and Lakota myths. The conflict between myth and reason, however, is also part of our world. Students investigate the contemporary meaning of myth with help from philosophers including Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Arendt."
