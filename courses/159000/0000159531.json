		"Since the 19th century, immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Islands have formed communities whose writing has expressed their shifting role as Asian Americans in the culture and economy of the United States. This course provides a multi-genre overview of Asian-American literary traditions in socio-historical context and pays attention to current concerns such as diasporic displacement, gender, intergenerational conflicts, sexuality, transnationalism, and U.S. militarism. Offered periodically. Also counts toward Asian studies and race and ethnic studies majors and race and ethnic studies concentration. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
