		"Human demands place immense pressure on finite energy and material resources. This course focuses on concepts and tools employed by environmental chemists to understand the chemical processes and phenomena associated with earth's compartments, chemical fate and transport, toxicity, chemical ecology, energy resources, and life cycle assessments. Through use and discussion of the primary literature students generate a research proposal that attends to the interplay of chemical cycles and systems while considering solutions to contemporary challenges. Offered alternate years during Spring semester (next time 2025). Prerequisite: Any level II course in biology, chemistry, and physics, or a level II or level III natural science course in environmental studies."
