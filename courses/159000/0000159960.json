		"This course explores the dance techniques of Party Dances, which began being termed \"Hip Hop\" dance in the 1980s. As a transformation of styles with Africanist parentage, this course focuses on the rhythm and groove embedded by the New York beginnings of proper Hip Hop. The course exposes students to the influence of Hip Hop on various cultures through the study of Party Dances and urban styles from New York to California, 1980s to now. May be repeated. P/N only. Offered each semester."
