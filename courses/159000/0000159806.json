		"This course introduces the history of ancient and imperial China beginning with the earliest historical records through the 19th century. In this broad sweep of history, students engage with works of literature, philosophy, religion, medicine, the arts, and political statecraft in English translation. Rather than focusing solely on political history and dynastic change, this course also explores the cultural and social lives of ordinary people as a central theme. Offered annually. Also counts toward Asian studies and Chinese majors and Asian studies concentration."
