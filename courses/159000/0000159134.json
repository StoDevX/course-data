		"In this course, students immerse themselves in Hamburg and Flensburg to explore the representations and concept of borders from a linguistic perspective. They inspect the intersecting roles of political, religious, socioeconomic, historical developments on past and current language systems and ideologies. They apply methods such as linguistic landscaping, linguistic historiography, and fieldwork journaling to develop their own research projects on socio-cultural border identities in Northern Germany. Knowledge of German is helpful, but not required. In the German Language Across the Curriculum (LAC) section, students speak in German about class readings and excursion observations and learn topic-specific terminology. Offered alternate years during January term."
