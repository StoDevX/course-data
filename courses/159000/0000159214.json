		"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that \"the inherent dignity and ... the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [are] the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\" Who speaks to human rights in East Asia? What ethical perspectives are voiced? Case studies presented through memoirs, films, reports, and multidisciplinary analyses provide the material for exploring diverse normative claims about individual rights in East Asia. Offered annually. This course is designed as a capstone experience for Asian Studies, Chinese and Japanese majors and Asian Studies concentrators. Other students need permission of instructor to enroll."
