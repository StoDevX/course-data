		"Students investigate notions of witchcraft, magic and the supernatural in Europe from the medieval period to today, survey beliefs and practices around the globe, and dive deep in the 17th century witch trials in early modern England. In addition to studying instructor-provided case studies, students prepare a \"teach-in\" day in pairs on a topic of their choosing, participate in a trial simulation, and examine written and visual primary sources. Offered annually in fall semester."
