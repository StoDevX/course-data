		"Students learn how gender is perceived, constructed, and experienced in contemporary Norway, using psychological and sociocultural perspectives to explore topics such as family life, youth development/empowerment, education, employment, media/advertising, health, and sexuality. They also examine Indigenous SÃ¡mi and immigrant perspectives. Lectures, site visits, and other field experiences augment scholarly readings and contribute to an understanding of gender equality as a foundational guiding principle and practice in an increasingly diverse Norwegian society. Offered alternate years during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Also counts toward Norwegian and gender and sexuality studies majors and Nordic studies and gender and sexuality studies concentrations. Prerequisites: PSYCH 125 or a course in Nordic studies, gender and sexuality studies, family studies, or sociology/anthropology, or permission of instructor; PSYCH 241 or PSYCH 249 strongly recommended."
