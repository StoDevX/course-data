		"Inspired by revered painter Georgia O'Keeffe's love of the New Mexican landscape, our group will explore the arts, nature, and culture of \"The Land of Enchantment.\" Beginning in Albuquerque, we will journey to Ghost Ranch for a week in O'Keeffe's meditative and artistic space, then head to Taos, a longstanding artists' colony in the Southernmost Rocky Mountains, and the Taos Pueblo, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States. Our trip culminates in the thriving arts hub of Santa Fe, visiting its galleries and museums. Offered alternate years during January term."
