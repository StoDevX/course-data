By examining the push and pull factors for immigration and emigration, and the challenges this creates for indigenous and minority groups, students gain an understanding of the interconnection of migrant experiences over time and geographical location. Students examine land taking of settler colonialism of Norwegian migrations both within Norway and Norwegian-America. Prerequisite: FYS and WRR."
