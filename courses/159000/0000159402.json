		"Students examine several tropical socio-ecological systems, including those situated in rainforest, montane cloud forest, dry forest, coastal, agricultural and urban landscapes. They learn about the impact of human activities on these systems and about Costa Rica's various policies and management practices aimed at more sustainable land use. Students consider how each person can contribute to sustainability within their own communities, and they gain practice through hands-on community conservation efforts. Offered periodically in January term. Prerequisite: ENVST 137 or ENCON 111 or permission of instructor."
