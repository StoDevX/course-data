		"Independent research is offered for students dedicated to an in-depth research experience. In conjunction with a faculty supervisor, a student conceives and performs a research project. Students develop skills reading, evaluating, and synthesizing scientific literature, making decisions about experimental design and implementation, and collecting and analyzing data. This course does not meet the level III biology requirement for the biology major because it does not fulfill the Writing in the Major requirement. However, it can count as an elective for the biology major. Independent research requires permission of a supervisor and completion of an independent research form available at the Registrar's Office or its website."
