A minimum of 80 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment (an Interim or its equivalent) is required prior to student teaching. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: Education 170: Urban Schools and Communities; Education 347: Teaching English as a Second Language; Education 378: Multicultural Education in Hawaii; Education 379: Urban Education Seminar and Practicum; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools with special cognitive component.
