		"All candidates must have a multicultural field experience to help develop their competence in teaching in multicultural environments. A minimum of 80 hours of field experience in a multicultural school environment (an Interim or its equivalent) is required prior to student teaching. All field experiences must be pre-approved. Below is a summary of options: Education 170: Urban Schools and Communities; Education 347: Teaching English as a Second Language; Education 378: Multicultural Education in Hawaii; Education 379: Urban Education Seminar and Practicum; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools with special cognitive component. See Education Department faculty and web site for advice and information. Education 382 is not a course. Rather it is a recording mechanism indicating St. Olaf students who have completed their multicultural education requirement. Students register for Education 382 during their professional semester. Offered each semester."
