Students analyze and compose Western tonal music that employs modal mixture, Neapolitan chords, augmented-sixth chords, and remote modulations, all of which are closely integrated into melodic and harmonic dictations. Students analyze the principle movement-length forms. Prerequisite: Music 114. Offered annually in the fall semester.",
