		"Students competing in intercollegiate athletics may use the season of participation in a varsity sport for 0.25 course credit in exercise science activity. Only one 0.25 course can be applied toward the two 0.25 course Physical Activity (PHA)/Studies in Physical Movement (SPM) graduation requirement. In addition, an intercollegiate exercise science activity course (0.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose of earning a credit toward the 35 full course credits requirement for graduation. It can only be used once as one-half of the two-course PHA/SPM requirement. Fall: varsity football, soccer, cross- country, women's volleyball; spring: remainder of intercollegiate sports. Participants in club sports are not eligible for academic credit. Students must register for the course during the competitive season, not afterwards."
