		"Env Studies 381 Garden's Healing Power",
		"This topic explores the role gardens play in healing the broken relationship society currently has with the environment and losses people have experienced through illness, death, or the loss of a beloved institution.",
		"Students look into rain gardens, Japanese gardens, healing gardens at hospitals and wellness centers, and play spaces designed to put very young children in touch with nature before the virtual world socializes them to find fulfillment only through electronic devices.",
		"The class will visit such gardens here in Northfield, learn from experts, and pursue civic engagement activity at nearby Way Park. Students have opportunities there to enhance its new rain gardens, move forward healing garden remembering the Northfield Hospital having been there for over 75 years, conceive of a natural lands play space, and tie all of these elements together in an inspiring vision for the city and Way Park visitors."
