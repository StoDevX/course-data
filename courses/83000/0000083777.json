		"Students study contemporary questions concerning the environment from the fundamental properties of matter to human impact on natural processes, including damage to and protection of the environment. Students discover how chemistry intersects with everyday living, especially the abilities and limitations of science to address environmental issues. Laboratory work explores the characteristics and analysis of hazardous and beneficial materials. Counts toward environmental studies major and concentration; does not count toward chemistry major. Offered during Interim."
