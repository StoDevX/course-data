	"desc": "The Biblical Animal - Adam and Eve frolic through a garden of living things, and Noah navigates a floating zoo. Jonah gets stuck in the belly of a big fish, and Job faces the unseemly monstrosities of Behemoth and Leviathan. Strange lambs, lions, beasts, dogs, doves, donkeys, and other creatures populate biblical texts, often unnoticed. With these nonhuman creatures in mind, this section will focus on \u0091ecotheological\u0092 and \u0091ecocritical\u0092 readings of creation in biblical narratives. We\u0092ll examine the bible\u0092s relationship to environmentalism and critical animal studies\u0097paying particular attention to how these texts portray what it means to be a \u0093human\u0094 or \u0093nonhuman\u0094 creature. We\u0092ll look at the vital roles nonhuman creatures play in these stories, and we\u0092ll ask what kinds of perspectives these creatures may give on the earth and contemporary environmental issues.",
