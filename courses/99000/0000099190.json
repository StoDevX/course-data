	"description": "This core course of Asian Studies introduces students to modern Chinese literature and society. It examines canonical and popular works of Chinese writings including fiction, drama, autobiography, correspondences, and poetry written in classical and modern styles from the late nineteenth century to the early twenty-first century. Films also serve as supplementary material when appropriate. Students read texts in translation and approach them in the context of modern Chinese society. They also study the literature as it reflects China's interaction with the West and the country's struggle to define itself as a modern nation. Offered annually.",
