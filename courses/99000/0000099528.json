These are the sorts of questions students explore as they navigate the basic systems that provide circulation, ventilation, movement, digestion, and waste removal. Students look at how these processes are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts, in dark, deep oceans, and places in between. In the weekly three-hour lab, they conduct quantitative physiological measurements to assess functions such as temperature control, respiration rates, and salt and water balance. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category. Counts toward mathematical biology and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisites: BIO 150; BIO 227 or CH/BI 227 recommended.",
