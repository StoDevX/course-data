		"This introduction to dance course allows students to broadly experience dance. Students explore dance from the following perspectives: historical, cultural and social, creative and expressive, performing, critical and aesthetic, and kinesthetic. The intention of the course is to broaden students' perceptions about dance. Lectures, student presentations, experiential movement labs, and viewing of both live and recorded dance performances are all components of the course. No dance experience required. Ticket/transportation fee required. Offered annually in the fall semester."
