	"description": "\u0093The Trickster\u0094 is an engaging and significant phenomenon in the lives of human beings all over the world. Thinking and writing about the trickster will help us discover an important part of ourselves as humans. We will read, discuss, and write about narratives and other discourses dealing with the trickster. These will include folktales, epic and fictional tales, and theoretical works. We will reflect on these readings and respond to them in our writings, particularly by using these materials as sources of inspiration. Student writing will be discussed in conferences with the instructor. Texts include Beti\u0092s The Poor Christ of Bomba, Niane\u0092s Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali, Radin\u0092s The Trickster, and Sandars\u0092 The Epic of Gilgamesh.",
