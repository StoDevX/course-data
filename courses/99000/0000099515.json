It is the starting point for a major in physics and is also appropriate for majors in fields such as chemistry or mathematics who desire more mathematical depth than would be used in the two-semester PHYS 124 - PHYS 125 sequence. Physics 130 is a study of Newtonian mechanics --- motion, forces, energy, gravity, and rotation. There is one 2.5 -hour laboratory meeting per week. Offered annually in the fall semester. Counts toward computer science major. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in (or previous completion of) MATH 119 or MATH 120 or equivalent.",
