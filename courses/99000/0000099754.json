		"Modern scientific work relies heavily on electronic circuitry and computation. This course examines the fundamentals of analog and digital electronics, explores the applications of discrete and integrated circuits, and introduces the broad topic of computer control of experiments. Students develop hands-on skills in circuit building, computer interfacing, and programming in LabView®. Students attend one laboratory period each week. Offered alternate years. Counts toward computer science major. Prerequisite: PHYS 125 or PHYS 131."
