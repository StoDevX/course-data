Exploring the human body's structure and function provides the foundation for moving in healthy, expressive, and creative ways. Emphasis is placed on living with awareness in daily life as a foundation for more specialized performance activities such as dance and sport. Offered annually in the fall semester. Counts toward biomedical studies concentration (for students through class of 2016) and neuroscience concentration. Prerequisites: DANCE 111 or DANCE 115, or permission of instructor.",
