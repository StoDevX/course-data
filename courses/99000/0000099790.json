		"\"Things are in the Saddle,/ And Ride Mankind\"....Emerson - In this seminar, we will think, talk, and write about “things,” exploring together the relations between people and stuff, dipping into creative and theoretical readings from the field of material culture studies. As always in a first-year seminar, we will work throughout the semester on writing skills, both at the sentence level and in a variety of essays. Some books we may read together include Taking Things Seriously; Life at Home in the Twenty-First Century: 32 Families Open Their Doors, and The Mezzanine."
