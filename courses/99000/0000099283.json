		"Gender in Africa - This seminar examines the contradictory images on gender in Africa promoted by colonial notions of man as the breadwinner and the woman jettisoned to a dependent position that defined metropolitan career trajectories. It examines differing gender norms and the resulting tensions as we interrogate the social, economic, and historical roles of women in Africa. Through lectures, discussions, films, and a varied list of intriguing sources and readings the course introduces students to \"doing history,\" as students appreciate and reconstruct the lived experiences of African women and explore themes such as slavery, religious and political roles, production, distribution and reproduction, domesticity, marriage and kingship, social change, and motherhood. The course pays particular attention to how women in Africa coped with society and not how society coped with them. No prior study of African history required."
