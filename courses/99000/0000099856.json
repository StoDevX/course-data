	"description": "This course explores modern computer hardware, emphasizing trade-offs among architectural choices and examining representative examples. Programming exercises explore how these topics relate to five high-level programming languages. Topics include virtual machines, overview of computer organization, forms of parallelism, machine-level implementation of programming language features, memory organization, digital logic, microprogrammed and RISC architectures, multi-core architectures, performance enhancements, assembly programming, and architecture of networks and their protocols. Offered annually. Counts toward management studies concentration. Prerequisite: CSCI 121 or CSCI 125 or consent of the instructor.",
