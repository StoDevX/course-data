	"desc": "Telling Stories About Climate Change - The most recent report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) doesn\u0092t pull any punches. The globe continues to warm, ice continues to melt at an alarming pace, and the seas continue to rise. Climate change is already happening. Yet, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, only 40% of Americans cited climate change as a major threat. So what gives? Why aren\u0092t people getting the message? Are we delivering it wrong? Do we need more stories, and better storytellers? This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? We\u0092ll frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels). In class, students write responses to assigned reading or films, work in small writing groups to give and receive feedback, and work on exercises that take up a certain element covered in our writing handbook. Additional writing assignments will include a personal essay, analysis essay, a research essay, short blog entries, a manifesto and more.",
