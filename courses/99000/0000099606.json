		"From Denarii to Dollars: Biblical Economics - What does the Bible have to do with economics? Can the Bible be used to guide our economic as well as spiritual practices? Understanding that economics means \u0093the law of the household,\u0094 this section will read the Bible in light of questions about issues such as wealth, prosperity, taxes, private property, and the market. To do so, we will look at the economic structures and concerns of a diverse biblical world rooted in an agrarian economy, tracing the recurrence of themes such as poverty, oppression, idolatry and the care for the land. Alongside of this focus on the Bible itself, we will examine how philosophers, theologians, and economists read the Bible to support certain economic practices, both in the past and within the contemporary context. Doing so will allow us to reflect on the continuing relevance of biblical economics for today."
