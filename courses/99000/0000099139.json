		"This course deepens and expands the body awareness focus of Dance 201, emphasizing the somatic perspective in which it is grounded. The somatic disciplines of Body-Mind Centering, Bartenieff Fundamentals, Ideokinesis, and Experimental Anatomy provide the theoretical foundation of this course. It includes exploration of the \"attention-intention-action cycle\" as life practice. Prerequisites: DANCE 201 and DANCE 212 or DANCE 213. Offered alternate years in the spring semester."
