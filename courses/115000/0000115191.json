	"description": "This course will provide the opportunity for in-depth exploration of three great British novelists, whose work spans three literary periods (the age of reason, the Victorian era, and the modernist revolution). All three brilliantly explored and exploited the formal potential of this relative newcomer among literary genres, \u0093the novel. \u0093 We will read two or three works by each author (texts such as Austen’s Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion; Eliot's The Mill on the Floss and Middlemarch; Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves). We’ll trace continuity of themes and the development of new literary forms from the late eighteenth to early twentieth centuries, and explore issues of literary influence (how does Eliot re-vision Austen? How does Woolf both re-read and revise Austen and Eliot?). We’ll also explore the territory of contemporary literary criticism (in our own times), and undertake final projects putting secondary sources in conversation with your ideas. Prerequisite: Open to rising juniors and seniors who have completed English 185 and at least two level-II English courses or by permission of the instructor.",
