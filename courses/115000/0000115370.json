		"In this course students examine Christians' enduring concern over such matters as what happiness is; the role, if any, virtues play in the lives of Christians and their lives with God. Topics include the early church's response to Greek philosophy, interpretations of sin, Christ's humanity, and human flourishing. Students also examine how these theological conversations continue to shape modern reflection on what makes a person happy and a life well-lived. Offered alternate years. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
