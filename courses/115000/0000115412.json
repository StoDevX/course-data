		"Students explore the history and culture of Ghana and examine how people recall slavery and the implications of a constructed concept of slavery. Through primary sources and visits to historic sites, students examine how Africans view slavery; why descendants of slavers and the enslaved rarely discuss slavery; how to transform slave artifacts into storehouses of memory, silences, and fragmentations in history; and how descendants of slaves respond to the burden of such knowledge. Offered during Interim. Counts toward Africa and the Americas and race and ethnic studies concentrations."
