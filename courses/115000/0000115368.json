	"description": "This seminar will use research to be presented at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting as the basis for discussions. We will read the most recent publications relating to neural control of behavior to prepare to attend poster sessions, symposia, and talks at the conference. Each topic will be considered in light of the role of the brain and the interpretation of behavior to better understand the development of research questions and the use of evidence to expand scientific knowledge. Travel to the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, is a required part of the course; funding for the trip is available. Prerequisites: Psych 238 or Neuro 239 and junior or senior standing. Registration by permission of instructor.",
