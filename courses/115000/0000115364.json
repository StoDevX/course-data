		"The pre-departure orientation seminar supports and enhances students' off-campus learning by increasing their preparation for a month of study and travel in India. Students employ a psychological perspective to read, discuss, and present literature about India's culture, history, and current issues. The study and practice of intercultural learning activities and the use of video conferencing and other resources support students' interactions and field projects with the group's hosts at universities and research sites in India."
