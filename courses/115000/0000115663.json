		"Populism—defined as “the people” versus “the interests”—has a central role in American politics and culture. The 2016 election featured right and left populisms. With roots in contests over democracy, notably the 19th-century People’s Party, populist movements have produced egalitarian and xenophobic politics, both yesterday and today. Populist culture ranges from Aaron Copland’s music to reality TV. This course explores these many varieties of populism, while placing American populism in a global context."
