		"This seminar introduces students to critical and cultural texts written by women of color to name the complex politics of race, gender, and sexuality. Using a family lens, students will develop intersectionality as an analytical tool with which to read how these systems of interlocking oppression have historically built social boundaries that have marginalized women of color identities. Readings will emphasize literary and cultural representations as acts of resistance to racial gender violence, racial homophobia, policing and militarization, and global economic inequality. Offered periodically, topics vary. Counts toward the Race and Ethnic Studies and Women's and Gender Studies major and concentration and the Family Studies concentration."
