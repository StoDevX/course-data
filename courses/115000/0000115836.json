		"This course focuses on screen-based media, from television to movies, video games to the internet, from theoretical and critical perspectives. Primary emphasis is on the diverse ways screen media production, distribution, and consumption inform contemporary issues in the public sphere. In particular, the course examines media discourses on identity, agency, and privacy, and how media representations of race, class, and gender presently exist as both products and producers of contemporary cultures. Prerequisite: MEDIA 160 or permission of instructor."
