		"Fences are a major feature in many landscapes, defining boundaries, and directing how humans and other species are distributed and move in their environment. This seminar-style course explores connections between fences and the environment. We will consider fences with particular emphasis on ecology and conservation as well as the role they play in art, literature, history, and politics. There will be an opportunity for hands-on experience in building fences. Counts as an elective within the environmental studies natural science area of emphasis."
