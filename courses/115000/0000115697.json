		"Computer science (CS) students team with students in non-CS fields in order to create custom web-based software that serves the research needs of particular professors in those non-CS fields of application. Students in a field of application provide disciplinary content, context, and feedback throughout project development, while pursuing relevant independent work. CS students develop software collaboratively and rapidly using the HiPerCiC (High-Performance Computing in Context) framework, while learning current web programming principles and technologies. Counts toward computer science major. Prerequisite: CSCI 251 or permission of instructor."
