		"In this course, students consider the intersections of art and politics in their dynamic historical frameworks, testing the positions of various artists and cultural commentators who claim that art accomplishes nothing in the \"real world\" or that politics ruin art. The course is interdisciplinary, comparing literature to other artistic forms such as music or film. Representative texts may include Ellison's Invisible Man, Dylan's songs, and Van Sant's film Milk. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW."
