		"In this research based, interdisciplinary seminar we consider the role of religion as a factor motivating migration by various groups, including refugees and immigrants, both in the past and more recently. We also examine interactions between migrant groups and American culture. In doing so we will be attentive to belief, behavior, and belonging by individuals and within communities. Religious diversity as a fact, and pluralism as a stance, are significant themes in our inquiry. Students employ digital tools and approaches to frame research questions; gather, analyze, and interpret data; and present their findings. This seminar is open to students in all fields of study, and is especially appropriate for those in religion, history, political science, and sociology/anthropology. Interested students are encouraged to consult with the instructor prior to registration."
