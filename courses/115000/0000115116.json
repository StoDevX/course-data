	"description": "Lucretius might best be described as a philosophical poet. His De Rerum Natura (\"On the Nature of the Universe\") presents the theories and teachings of Greek philosophers like Democritus and Epicurus, but with a Roman flavor. Students translate substantial sections of this fascinating poem. Offered periodically. Counts toward ancient studies and medieval studies majors. Prerequisite: LATIN 231 or equivalent.",
