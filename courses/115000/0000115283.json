		"This course serves as an introductory survey of the diverse arts and cultures of sub-Saharan Africa.

Special topics considered may include: contemporary versus historical art in Africa, notions of \"authenticity\" and tourist art, cultural heritage and repatriation of art works, and the politics and history of museum display.
