		"This course engages students in problem solving and introduces them to abstract mathematical thinking, with an emphasis on mathematical reasoning and writing. Using a variety of topics as the backdrop, students learn to investigate, to make conjectures, and to express themselves using precise mathematical language. Topics may include number theory, graph theory, game theory, combinatorics, and more. Students may not take this course after MATH 244 or MATH 252 without permission of instructor. Offered annually. Prerequsites: MATH 119 or MATH 120 or CSCI 121 or CSCI 125 or permission of instructor."
