		"Students study Nordic conflict resolution theories and practices as those relate to various approaches to conflict resolution, peace, and nonviolent resistance around the globe. What key strategies are individuals and groups using in creating just communities and a just world? The course offers academic inquiry into people's movements and interactive training methods. Students examine both theoretical premises and conflict resolution mechanisms as they together produce decisions about power and peace. Counts toward the Nordic Studies concentration. Offered periodically."
