	"description": "This course explores the use of non-rigid materials in sculpture, such as textiles, fibers, inflatables, pourables and found material. Students will learn about soft sculpture as a historical and contemporary medium by looking at artists such as Claes Oldenburg, Lynda Benglis and Yayoi Kasuma. Students will acquire basic knitting and sewing skills as well as welding and wood-working techniques for building armatures. Material investigations will focus on surface/structure, gravity/buoyancy and permeability. The class will explore how issues of craft, fashion and the unmonumental relate to the genre of soft sculpture.",
