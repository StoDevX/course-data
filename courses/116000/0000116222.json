		"This course investigates the interrelationships between humans and their surroundings in New Zealand and Australia. Students study conditions and practices that encourage human flourishing though with special applied schooling in matters of ethics and the environment. The off-campus portion of the course integrates psychological and environmental discourses with personal experience and mindfulness practices. Students explore meanings, values, and questions that demonstrate how the ability to flourish relies on individual, collective, and ethical thought and action in relationship to place and environmental stewardship. Offered Interim 2018 only. Prerequisite: BTS-T and membership in St. Olaf Band."
