		"In recent decades the Nordic countries have been transformed from homogenous nation-states to increasingly plural societies in terms of religion, culture and ethnicity. Immigration from various parts of the world has given the Nordic region a newfound cosmopolitanism, and the response has been both positive and negative. In this course we take a close look at the immigrant experience as presented in both film and literature. We will examine how immigrants negotiate between their past experiences and new homes, and how that in turn challenges conventional ideas about Nordic identities. We will also take a look back at the great emigration in the late 19th century as many Scandinavians made their new homes in Minnesota among other places. In addition to films and novels, class material will include scholarship on world cinema, multicultural literature, immigration, exile, travel and translation."
