		"This course explores methods of designing and analysing scientific experiments to address research questions, emphasizing statistical thinking and applications using real data as much as underlying mathematical structures and theory. Topics include completely randomized factorial designs, randomized block designs, split-plot designs, general linear models, and random effects models. Computer applications are integrated throughout. Prerequisite: Statistics 272 or permission of instructor. Offered during 2009-10 and alternate years."
