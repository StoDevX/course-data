	"description": "This course will introduce students to the theoretical and methodological concepts and approaches needed for a sociological (and social scientific) understanding of music, organized loosely around issues of production, content, and reception, but also providing (and borrowing) insight from major sociological topics like culture, organizations and institutions, social networks, race, class, gender, sexuality, and politics. We will also draw on history, anthropology, economics, and literature. It should be noted that, while interdisciplinary to an extent, the course remains rooted in sociology.",
