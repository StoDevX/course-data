		"Students encounter theories of cultural competency through the development of intellectual, kinesthetic, and emotional knowledge and skills within a study of Japanese visual arts, drama, and theater. Through readings, structured experiences, reflective exercises, and personal assessment tools, students explore aspects of Japanese culture through the lens of the arts. Field experiences include visits to Japanese theatres, museums, temples, gardens, and palaces. The course begins with two weeks of study on campus followed by a tour of Japan for two weeks and is open only to students who will tour Japan with the St. Olaf Band. Offered only in Interim 2010."
