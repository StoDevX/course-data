	"description": "This course develops the methodological framework which guides economic inquiry, while it reviews mathematical fundamentals and develops quantitative skills used in core courses of the major. Students learn to apply mathematical optimization to economic problems. This course may substitute for the second required math course if taken prior to the core courses; it does not count toward the major. Prerequisites: one of Economics 110-122 and Math 110, 120, or 122. Offered each semester.",
