		"Students reflect on their own culture as they explore childhood and family life in China and Japan. Developmental and cross-cultural research, memoirs, works of fiction, and films are used to study parents' beliefs and childrearing practices as well as the development of the self, peer relationships, school achievement, and role changes during adulthood. With life expectancy increasing around the world, students also discover how China and Japan are responding to the graying of their populations. Prerequisites: Psychology 125 or Asian Studies 111 or Asian Studies 121."
