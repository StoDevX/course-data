		"Students explore the theory and practice of Public History as they learn to identify and interpret history for the public. Using readings, workshops, site visits, and individual and collaborative projects, students explore how ownership and funding influence decisions regarding what is preserved; how the past informs the present; how the present may oppose the past; and how cultures engage in remembering their pasts in ways consistent with the common good. Offered annually. Prerequisite: history major or permission of instructor."
