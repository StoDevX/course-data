		"The Bright Ages: The European Middle Ages and the World - There’s no such thing as the Dark Ages. Rome didn’t fall. The Renaissance didn’t make everything nice. And most of the stories told most commonly in popular culture about medieval times turns out to be wrong. In this class, we’ll move through a thousand years of European history and see how although things changed, Europe always remained a complicated place with permeable boundaries in touch with the rest of the world. It was a Bright Age indeed, illuminated with vibrant colorful passing through stained glass windows and the fires of burning books and cities alike."
