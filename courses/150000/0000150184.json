		"This discussion-based course will assess the lived experiences and biographies of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals who lived in \"Europe\" (broadly conceived) between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition to exploring the major theoretical influences on the field of \"queer history,\" including the work of Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Jen Manion, this course will allow students to examine the development of LGBT communities in a broad range of national contexts, urban and rural sexual subcultures, and the related histories of regulation, medicalization, and categorization. Among the topics we will cover during the course of the semester will be the emergence of gay subcultures in London, Berlin, and Paris; the rise of sexology and the growth of \"sexual science\"; the history of transgender peoples; and the rise of the modern gay rights movement."
