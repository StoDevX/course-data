		"In this course, students analyze globalization and its consequences through two related lenses: the ethical and the literary. First, students explore this phenomenon historically and philosophically, and consider different ethical responses to globalization's consequences. Then, students read and analyze works of Anglophone literature (English-language literature from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean) that engage these very issues. This approach both reorients understandings of the ethics of globalization and emphasizes the role of literature in ethical inquiry. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
