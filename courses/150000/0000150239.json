		"What does it mean to think scientifically about the human experience? How is scientific thinking a crucial part of being human? This seminar explores such questions through readings by natural scientists and social scientists, along with student conversations and projects. We will learn about: how humans think; the attractions of laboratory work; the difficulties of promoting health, treating illness, and encountering mortality; and the strange, diverse journeys of college students. We will encounter the beauty and messiness of science while exploring how scientists grapple with human complexity in these different domains. The course features two linked sections, with a mixture of joint and separate class sessions, and the opportunity to work with two professors from different departments."
