		"This first-year seminar, guided by a biochemist and amateur foodie, seeks to gather curious, adventurous students through discussion and active engagement, into a community to explore our complex relationship with food. From the molecular level of how volatile organic compounds interact with the receptors of the olfactory epithelium, to the lived experiences we all bring to the table, this course serves as a mixing bowl where we each add and where we all can consume the richness created from the diverse ingredients bravely offered and willingly shared by first-semester college students."
