		"Engaging the diverse cultures and Asian American communities in San Francisco, students learn about the intersection of power, race, class, gender, sexuality, language, and multiculturalism. Students examine the past through immigration history, museums, and Angel Island; experience the present in Chinatown, Nihonmachi (Japantown), and the Castro District; and explore the future by connecting with alumni, academics, and Silicon Valley professionals. Through guest lectures, readings, discussions, field trips, and digital projects, students gain unique perspective and knowledge in one of the historical, political, and cultural centers of Asian America. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Also counts toward Chinese, Japanese, and race and ethnic studies majors and race and ethnic studies concentration. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing or above."
