	"description": [
		"\"Imagine Asia\" explores the concepts of \"self\" and \"other\" in both Asian and American contexts, taking them as entry points for engaging with the histories, cultures, and communities of the region. We will examine how Asia has been integrated into the global circuits of meaning, imagination, and (mis)representations and what popular media can reveal about power, race, gender, sexuality, and national identities. As a writing and rhetoric course, students will write in multiple genres and engage in writing as a systematic, interactive process for different purposes and audiences. This is the second course in a four-course Conversation Program. Prerequisite: ASCON 110."
