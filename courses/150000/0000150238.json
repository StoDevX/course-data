		"\"Heritage\" is a term with many meanings. It can relate to cultural and natural landmarks, to artifacts and their production, to languages and other cultural practices, and it is part of a collective identity, but also our individual identities. As an example in the US-context, think of the Statue of Liberty and its symbolic power of freedom and opportunity in the immigration history of this nation. Your own identification as an American may be quite different, depending on your own history and experiences. In this class, we will look at different shapes that \"heritage\" takes on and reflect on how \"heritage\" connects back to us. Through discussions of different texts and project work, we will collaboratively further our understanding of heritage and approach Ole Question 1: In what ways can I understand the world and my role in it?"
