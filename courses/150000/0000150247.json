		"We’ve much to learn from the witches of the past. Not, of course, how to curse our enemies or brew love potions. Rather, witchcraft and magic are components of the supernatural that will help us understand cultures of the past (including the recent past), and the people who produced them. In this class we’ll learn about what the alleged witches thought of themselves, and how magic helped them (and those around them) understand their world. While magic and witchcraft have had some place in human societies for millenia (and still today!), those presumed to wield that power have been accepted or rejected to varying degrees. Accusations of witchcraft, moreover, have also historically been employed to rob others of power. Witchcraft and magic are implicated in social, economic, and political histories, and are heavily tied into the social construction of gender and the history of women. In this course we will investigate notions of witchcraft, magic and the supernatural in Europe from the medieval period to today, survey beliefs and practices around the globe, and dive deep in the 17th century witch trials in early modern England."
