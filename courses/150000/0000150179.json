		"As the world has become a global village, interconnected by powerful media systems, new challenges for democracy are emerging daily. How do we address the ways social media is both uniting and dividing us, empowering some communities while obliterating others? How do we regulate the rise of data-driven surveillance and the loss of privacy? How do we prepare for the role of artificial intelligence in the production and distribution of media, and its implications for democratic political processes? In this course we will look at the media's unequal and varied effects on the current and future status of democracy and digital citizenship, and produce related media content of our own."
