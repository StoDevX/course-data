		"Our identities are personal, cultural, multi-faceted and ever-evolving. How is our use of language an expression of those identities? How does language interact with the ways that we understand and make a place for ourselves in the world around us? In this course, we will read a variety of genres, observe discourse in action, and reflect on our own participation in campus conversations in order to develop a critical awareness of the ways that we speak and write, especially in a college context. This course is writing intensive and emphasizes critical thinking, conversation, collaboration, and academic habits for the liberal arts. Students will be encouraged to explore the course topics guided by their individual interests, with ample feedback from the instructor and from peers."
