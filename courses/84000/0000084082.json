		"This course is an intensive introduction to the history of the art and architecture of Florence. Through a study of Florence's topography, its built environment, and painted and sculpted imagery, students study the history of Florence from its inception as a Roman colony through the 19th century when Florence was the capital of the newly unified Italian nation. The study of Florence is enriched by travel to other Tuscan cities such as Cortona, Siena, and Lucca. Offered during Interim in alternate years."
