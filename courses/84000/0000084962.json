		"Quantum mechanics has changed the conceptual framework for our understanding of atoms and molecules, both as free particles and in condensed states of matter. It also guides our understanding of the nucleus and elementary particles. This course examines these discoveries and several applications they produced. Prerequisites: Physics 232 and concurrent registration in Physics 245 and Math 230. Offered annually in the spring semester."
