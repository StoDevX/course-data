		"This course provides the technical and conceptual foundations for use of digital media for artistic expression. The course focuses on the interaction of the conceptual and the technical through readings, lecture, and assignments that address fundamental issues of digital arts: digital reproduction and representation, intermedia, and interface. Students acquire basic technical skills and apply them in the development of digital art projects that span four realms: raster graphics, vector graphics, three-dimensional graphics, and web page construction. This course prepares students for upper level art courses in the curriculum: Motion Graphics, Computer-Based Imagery and Video Art Production."
