		"Humans relate to one another in couples, families, groups, organizations and communities. Through social systems theory, ethics and a strengths perspective, students apply prerequisite and advanced theoretical research material from biology, sociology, and psychology to assess situations encountered by social workers. Diverse examples are drawn from literature -- Love in the Driest Season, The Color of Water, A Poison Stronger than Love -- and from students' autobiographies. Prerequisites: Sociology 121, Psychology 241, and Biology 123 or 243; open to non-majors by permission of program director only. Offered Fall Semester."
