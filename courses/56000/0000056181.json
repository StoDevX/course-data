		"Students study basic concepts and approaches of film analysis, while examining aesthetics, themes and techniques of masterworks directed by Chinese Fifth Generation directors. Through readings of cinema theory and criticism and class discussions, students explore artistic merits in these films and aspects of Chinese society and culture in contemporary China, particularly the changes which occurred since 1978 with China's Four Modernizations. All readings are in English."
