		"This introduction to dance allows students to broadly experience and learn about dance. Students explore dance from the following perspectives: historical, cultural and social, creative and expressive, performing, critical and aesthetic, and kinesthetic. Lectures, experiential movement labs, and viewing of both live and recorded dance performances are all components of the course. No dance experience required. A ticket/transportation fee is required for performances. Offered Fall Semester."
