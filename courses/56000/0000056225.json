		"The prerequisite for this class is the completion of the requirements in the exercise science major. Students may be co-registered for the capstone course and their final core course in the major. Presentations by the faculty of the Department of Exercise Science and other experts build upon material presented in the introductory and core courses and introduce students to advanced topics in exercise science. Students conduct semester-long research on a topic and present their findings in the form of a research paper."
