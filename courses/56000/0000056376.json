		"Students explore analytical applications, problem solving and understanding how people and instruments operate together to make things happen. Problems include how systems of amplifiers detect signals, how computers process and display them and how people use networks to transfer the information to others who need it. A lab robot is used to prepare samples and to do analyses. Prerequisite: concurrent registration in Chemistry 382. P/N only. Offered Fall Semester."
