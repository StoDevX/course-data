		"Students embark on a cross-cultural exploration of concert dance and pedestrian movement in religious and social contexts to increase intercultural sensitivity and competence. The emphasis is on discovering how movement and dance express and communicate cultural values, as well as developing the skills to perceive, describe, interpret, and evaluate movement. Includes studio, classroom, and field experiences. A ticket/transportation fee is required for trips to performances in the Twin Cities. Offered most years."
