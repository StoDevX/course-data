Students trace the development of new sources of authority including the new science with its influence on art, literature, politics, and philosophy. Discussions consider Luther, Calvin, Descartes, Locke, Milton, Aphra Behn, Voltaire, Rousseau, Goethe, andTeresa of Avila and the artistry of Michaelangelo, Caravaggio, Bach, and Shakespeare."
