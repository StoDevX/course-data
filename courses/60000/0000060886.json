		"Students explore problems about the nature of space and time that are of common interest to philosophers and scientists: Do space and time have boundaries? Are space and time independent of minds and bodies? How are space and time conceived in classical vs. relativistic physics? What is the geometry of space? Is time travel possible? What is God's relation to space and time? Offered Interim only."
