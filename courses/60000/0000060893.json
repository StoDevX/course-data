		"Students study the moral theory of Immanuel Kant by reading his texts and understanding the expression of their ideas in literature and film. They also clarify Kant's moral theory through comparison of his theory to other moral theories, especially utilitarianism and virtue theory. The overall purpose of the course is to help students to understand and apply moral theories generally, and Kant's theory in particular, to particular moral situations."
