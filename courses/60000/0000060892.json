	"desc": "The history of British colonization of America, Africa, Asia, and Australia coincides with the history of the novel's emergence as the major literary genre in English. This course examines this parallel history by considering the ways in which the colonial experience has been represented in novels from the 18th century to the present. We will read six novels, tracing this development in America, Africa, and Asia, and discuss the novels both in relationship to the development of the novel in general, and to their place in colonial or postcolonial history.
