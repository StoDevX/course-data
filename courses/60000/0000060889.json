		"Students examine selected English prose, poetry, and/or drama by Canada's three founding peoples (English, French, First Nations). This course emphasizes connections between place and identity in Canadian writing and the relationship of that writing to British and American counterparts. It also helps students to achieve an informed appreciation of the aesthetic and formal properties of Canadian literature, as well as an understanding of the place of that literature within the broader context of human life and culture. Students read authors like Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje, Leonard Cohen, Thomas King, and Jacques Poulin. Offered every 2-3 years. Prerequisite: First-Year Writing or equivalent."
