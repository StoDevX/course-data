		"A quarter-credit course devoted to a broad study of the field of biomolecular science through the reading and discussion of primary and secondary literature across the field. Through exploration of the breadth of the field, biomolecular concentrators plan their own 300-level course structure. While required of all biomolecular concentrators, this course is open to all interested students. P/N only. Prerequisites: either Biology 125, or Chemistry 125 or the equivalent. Offered Spring Semester."
