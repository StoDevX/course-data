		"Revolutionary changes occurred in economics, politics, philosophy, aesthetics and women's roles at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. Students consider the development of modern social and natural sciences and examine various attempts to restate the Western tradition in the face of continuing intellectual and social transformations. Students discuss Burke, Paine, Wollstonecraft, Shelley, Mill, Kierkegaard, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Woolf, Proust, Niebuhr, and King and the artistry of Beethoven, Ibsen, David, and Picasso."
