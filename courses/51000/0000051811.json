		"Revolutionary changes occurred in economics, politics, philosophy, aesthetics and women's roles at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.

Students discuss Burke, Paine, Wollstonecraft, Shelley, Mill, Kierkegaard, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Woolf, Proust, Niebuhr, and King and the artistry of Beethoven, Ibsen, David, and Picasso."
