		"Romantic comedy was invented by Shakespeare and perfected by Jane Austen. We will begin with \"As You Like It\", \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" and then look at American movie romantic comedies from the Thirties to the present: \"It Happened One Night\", \"Bringing Up Baby\", \"The Lady Eve\", \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Groundhog Day\" and \"Before Sunrise\". These comedies celebrate a distinctively American woman who, in the words of Alexis de Tocqueville, is \"always mistress of herself.\" Film noir, rooted in hard-boiled detective fiction, presents this same independent woman in much darker light. Our examples here will be \"The Big Sleep\", \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"Double Indemnity\", \"Out of the Past\" and \"Red Rock West\"."
