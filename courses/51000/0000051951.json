		"This course examines how contemporary culture influences present day wellness perspectives. Values, lifestyle, daily stresses, and corresponding coping mechanisms affecting one's well-being are explored. Students study health behaviors as a function of social influences and, conversely, the impact of unhealthy coping behaviors on the social enterprise. This course also includes an exploration of wellness from the perspective of non-western cultures."
