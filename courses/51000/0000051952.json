		"Social work majors continue the \"how-to\" of generalist practice. They assess strengths and problems of diverse groups, organizations and communities and use the systems perspective to help an organization or community frame its goals and plans for social change. Students scientifically assess communities; meet community practice social workers; and develop plans for implementing change that are reflective, scientific, just and grounded in the liberal arts. Prerequisite: Social Work 254. Offered Spring Semester."
