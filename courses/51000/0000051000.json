	"desc": "How do we learn science? What approaches can be used to understand and interpret scientific information? While \"ecology\" in the strict sense refers to a specific field within biology, the word may also be used more broadly to refer to the interactions that organisms have with both living and non-living components of their environments. This seminar will provide students with natural science experiences in ecology as well as explorations of different methods of learning and knowing science. Field experiments and biography, data collection and aesthetics, scientific analyses and history, will be among the different approaches students take in each of the seminar topics, and in a final group project.",
