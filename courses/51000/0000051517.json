		"Zoological parks serve a critical role in the 21st century, preserving endangered species, and educating the public. Are zoos our best bet for preserving rare species, or would our time and money be better spent preserving the habitats that species require? This course gives students a background in conservation biology, zoo biology, and first-hand experience conducting research in a zoo setting. Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 125 or 137; Biology 126 and 261. Offered only during Interim."
