	"description": [
		"How do psychologists characterize the most basic aspects of the learning process? While some emphasis is on analysis of the behavioral viewpoint (Pavlov, Skinner), students also examine the ways current investigators apply these basic principles to problems in other fields. These include behavioral therapy for a variety of psychological disturbances, research on the neurobiology of drug reward, and analysis of consumer behavior. The course includes lecture and laboratory work with nonhuman animals. Prerequisite: Psychology 125 or Biology 125. Offered annually. Counts toward neuroscience concentration."
