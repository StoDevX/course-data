The accompanying lab course, Chemistry 256, illustrates the topics discussed in Chemistry 255. Students taking this course use computers for solving problems. Prerequisite: Chemistry 126 or Chemistry/Biology 227 or permission of the instructor. Concurrent registration in Chemistry 256 is required. Offered each semester.
