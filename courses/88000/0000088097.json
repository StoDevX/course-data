	"desc": "This course investigates how literature--broadly writ--represents gender diversity and conformity and the issues associated with gender, such as: family, power dynamics, oppression, activism, domesticity, hierarchies, and inequalities. The texts of the course focus on a diversity of gendered identities by complicating the gender binary of \"man\" and \"woman.\" A consideration of gender separated from other identities is limiting; therefore, this course examines how gender is embedded with race, class, ability, sexual orientation, technology, religion, and/or nationality. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alterate years. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term.",
