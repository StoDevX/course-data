		"The seminar focuses on the theory and practice of oral history. Students learn to conduct, transcribe and incorporate interviews in projects. Students interrogate conceptual issues - the interview as narrative, memory, identity, connections, motivations, and the silences inherent in oral history - and how these relate to gender, religion, and class in multiple global settings. Students learn such practical techniques as how to probe social masks, evaluate oral evidence, and the legalities of releasing interviews. Offered annually. Counts toward history major and Africa and the Americas concentration."
