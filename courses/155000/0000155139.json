		"Students explore what it means to be literate in an age of new media by reading critical scholarship and comparing the ways they read, interpret, and learn from digital texts to ways they read, interpret, and learn from print media. In their final, digital project, students critically examine the use of new media to make humanities scholarship more public. Offered annually. Also counts toward media studies concentration. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
