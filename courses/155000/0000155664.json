		"If love makes the world go 'round might it also play a role in restoring it? In the present ecological age, human practices are changing environments in unprecedented ways. This course explores whether -and if so how- a love of nature can promote shared planetary health. Students consider the working Biophilia Hypothesis and ways connection with other-than-human life fosters human flourishing through focused study on childhood and human development, design, and the built environment. This course fulfills an Environmental Studies elective. Prerequisite: ENVST 137 or ENCON 111."
