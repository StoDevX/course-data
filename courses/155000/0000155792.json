		"This course explores in-depth the intersection between Indigenous spirituality and Christianity in North America. It focuses on the impact of Christian missionaries on pre-contact Native philosophy, with a special emphasis on Lakota values such as orality and narrative. Case studies will offer critical insights into how these values have shaped Indigenous identity and its intersection with Christian faith, illuminating the complex dynamics of cultural interaction and religious transformation, while providing historical and contemporary contexts."
