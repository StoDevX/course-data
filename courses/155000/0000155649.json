		"Students read a selection of 20th & 21st century Japanese literary works written by women. Close readings and class discussions focus on representations of the (female) body and bodily/embodied experiences in the assigned texts. What do these representations reveal about specific social contexts and gendered roles/expectations in Japanese society? Gender is a primary analytical concern, and students must feel comfortable reading about and discussing gender, sexuality, and the body. All course materials are read in English translation. No knowledge of Japanese is required."
