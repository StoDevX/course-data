	"description": [
		"The study of global change and human environmental impacts requires students to link concepts from biology, chemistry, and physics. Students investigate these links by exploring current theories in biogeochemistry, with an emphasis on understanding the feedback between physical and ecological processes and the coupling of multiple element cycles. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour lab per week. Laboratory activities focus on a practical exploration of the methods biogeochemists use, including experience with a variety of instruments. Also counts toward mathematical biology concentration. Prerequisite: any level II biology, chemistry, or physics course or permission of instructor."
