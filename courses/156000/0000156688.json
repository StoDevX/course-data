		"This course introduces students to the vibrant, interdisciplinary, and growing fields of materials engineering and nanoscale science. Students focus primarily on the relationship between the structure and physical properties of materials, on length scales ranging from millimeters to nanometers. Students research articles from the peer-review literature that highlight the latest developments in the field. Students also discuss the technological and societal impacts of different materials and their applications. Offered annually. Prerequisite: PHYS 244."
