		"Students begin the conversation with three basic questions: 1) Who am I and what is my relationship with the environment? 2) How can I express that relationship to others? and 3) What is my environmental role in my community? To answer these questions, students explore their environmental selves through collaborative conversations, group activities, and critical thinking exercises. Through common readings, students hone their research skills, improve oral and written performance, and reflect on what it is to learn among a community of scholars. This course is the first in a three-course Conversation Program."
