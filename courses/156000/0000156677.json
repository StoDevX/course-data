		"This course explores how musicians and music researchers impact society. Building on skills and concepts developed in Music 141, this course addresses questions related to ethical musicking in an unequal world. Students study a series of case studies, experience hands-on workshops with local performers, and design community engaged music research proposals. Studying local examples of engagement with music and musicians from around the world prepares students to carry out collaborative musical work wherever they are. Prerequisites: MUSIC 141 or permission of instructor."
