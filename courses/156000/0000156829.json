		"This course prepares students with tools for understanding how research studies in psychology are conceptualized, designed, and ethically conducted, and how data is analyzed, interpreted, and disseminated.

Students attend lectures plus one two-hour laboratory per week. Offered each semester. Also counts toward environmental studies major, kinesiology major, and statistics and data science and public health studies concentrations.
