		"This course emphasizes the theoretical foundations, mathematical structure, and applications of major econometric techniques appropriate for time-series data. Topics covered include generalized least squares, single-equation time-series models, multi-variable time-series models, forecasting and forecast evaluation, and seasonality. This course is recommended for students interested in analysis of issues in macroeconomics and finance. Offered annually. ECON 384 and ECON 385 may not both be used to satisfy the economic analysis requirements for either the economics or quantitative economics major. Completion of MATH 220 may be helpful but is not required. Prerequisites: ECON 261 and one of ECON 260 or ECON 263 or STAT 272; or permission of instructor."
