		"This course examines the history of the Maya peoples from the colonial to the present. Drawing upon missionary accounts, archeological sources and historical and anthropological works, we will explore how the Maya -- despite the multiple traumas of conquest, demographic collapse and state repression -- have managed to survive as a people. Specific topics include: Maya religious beliefs, the impact of Spanish conquest, changing sources of ethnic identity and the emerging Pan-Maya movement of recent years. Offered periodically."
