	"description": "Conservation biology focuses on the study of biological diversity. We will examine why we should be concerned about the number and types of species on earth, what factors threaten the survival of species and how we can conserve them. Using principles of ecology and evolution, with input from other disciplines, students gain a better understanding of the impact of humans on biodiversity and the importance of responsible environmental decision-making. Offered annually. Counts toward major and concentration: Environmental Studies.",
