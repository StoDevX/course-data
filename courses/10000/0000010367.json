		"Students study how an instrument functions, mechanically, mathematically, optically and electronically, and then how its parts are linked together. Students examine electrochemical devices: spectrophotometers for absorption, emission, scattering and resonance; devices that manipulate particles; and a host of chromatographic devices. Prerequisites: Physics 125L or 228, and Chemistry 255, 256. Concurrent registration in Chemistry 378 is required. Prior experience with computers is essential. Offered Fall Semester."
