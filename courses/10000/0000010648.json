		"Life is a risky proposition. How do we determine if an activity or choice exceeds our sense of reasonable risk? How does an understanding of risk, or lack thereof, translate into political policies? Rational risk assessment relies on the application of scientific principles and methodology. Students will explore how biology and chemistry play prominent, interdependent roles in understanding the risks associated with daily life. Students will study and apply the principles of science-based assessment and compare/contrast the outcomes to the portrayal of risk in the popular press."
