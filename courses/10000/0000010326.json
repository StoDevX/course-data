What does it mean to be free? Students explore the institutions, images and stories of Euro-Americans, African Americans and Native Americans.Topics and texts include the Declaration of Independence and Thomas Jefferson's architecture, the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and the coming of the Civil War."
