		"Moral issues concerning friendship and love are analyzed from the perspective of various theories of value. Issues may include friendship and the moral life, exploitative versus fulfilling relationships, the conflict between altruism and self-love, forgiveness, reconciliation and civic friendship. Since loving is itself a form of valuing, value theory is approached by investigating philosophical and theological works concerning the basic types of love: philia, eros and agape. Students are introduced to normative ethical theories."
