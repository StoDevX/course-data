		"This course provides a strong visual foundation in fundamental drawing skills. Students explore elements of line, space, texture and value, as well as their dynamics in composition. Projects emphasize translating observed three-dimensional subjects onto two-dimensional surfaces. In addition, students are introduced to the aesthetics of drawing and drawing as a means of self-expression through the study of old and contemporary masters. Lab fee."
