		"This course emphasizes adaptive mechanisms in relation to the environment (i.e., desert kangaroo rat kidneys compared to aquatic beaver kidneys). Systems covered include permeability and transport, osmoregulation, thermoregulation, muscle, neurophysiology, respiration, circulation, digestion and metabolism. Investigative laboratories enable students to measure numerous physiological parameters in living animals using computers and other equipment. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Taught annually. Prerequisites: Biology 125 and 126."
