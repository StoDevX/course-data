		"This courses addresses the question: Can the human mind be understood scientifically? Students will examine the recent history of attempts to establish a science of psychology as well as current psychological theories or research programs and their conceptual foundations. The philosophical implications of these theories for our understanding of such things as the relation between minds and brains, freedom and determinism, reason and emotion and the nature of the self are also explored."
