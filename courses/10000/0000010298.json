		"Plants are a diverse and important group of organisms. This course considers their evolution, emphasizing the morphology and anatomy of flowering plants. Students learn about basic techniques of data collection and analysis to investigate plant evolution: identifying plants, dissecting and staining plant structures and using computer-based taxonomic statistics programs. Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory per week. Taught annually. Prerequisites: Biology 125 and 126."
