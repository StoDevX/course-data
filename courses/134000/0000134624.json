	"description": [
		"This course critically engages the notion of European identity by exploring the idea of the Grand Tour and the emergence of national museums. Students will experience firsthand some of the sites, artifacts, and works of art encountered in the Great Conversation program and reflect on the ways in which the program, like the Grand Tour itself, delineates cultural borders as well as disrupts them. Offered alternate years during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies. Prerequisite: completion of GCON 217 or permission of the instructor."
