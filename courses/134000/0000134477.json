		"What is Chinese diaspora? In this course we will compare modern Chinese immigration with ancient Chinese exodus and exile, in addition to comparisons with the migration of an empire, and the sojourns of officials, students, and merchants. Students will read a selection of literary and scholarly works, examining not only the genres in their cultural contexts, but also the borders that the Chinese diaspora crossed, the places where they went, and the environments to which they tried/failed to adapt. Finally, we will look into chapter novels, novellas, and films in which post-loyalism, creolization, and gender are considered while Chineseness and diaspora are re-considered. Counts toward Asian Studies and Chinese majors."
