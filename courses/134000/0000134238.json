		"This course examines the literary, musical, and popular culture expressions of several counterculture movements in America after 1945, beginning with the Beat Generation of the 1950s and extending to activist, hippie, and radical black countercultures of the 1960s and Punk, No-Wave, and Hip Hop movements of the 1960s and 70s. Students read works by writers such as Kerouac, Ginsberg, Dylan, Gil Scott Heron, Patti Smith, Lydia Lunch, Los Bros Hernandez, and Chuck D, and examine relationships between countercultural expression and historical, social, and political developments of the era. Prerequisite: FYW."
