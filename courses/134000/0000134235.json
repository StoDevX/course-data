With topics varying from term to term, students read both \"cutting edge\" research and the classic articles of the field. The methodology employed in the research is a central topic. Students ask whether the methods are appropriate and helpful for answering the central questions of American politics. The course also includes a major research project. Prerequisites: PSCI 220 and one course in the subfield, or permission of instructor."
