		"Trying to define \"comedy\" is deceptively difficult. While the first definition that comes to mind - anything that is humorous and makes the reader laugh - seems the clearest, it raises a host of questions. Are any topics universally funny? Can the genre apply to a work during which the reader never laughs? Do comedies offer a chance to engage more deeply with, or ignore, social issues? In this class, students analyze a variety of texts considered \"comedies\" - possibly including Arvind Adiga's White Tiger, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, and Monty Python and the Holy Grail - to explore the literary, social, and ethical debates in this slippery genre."
