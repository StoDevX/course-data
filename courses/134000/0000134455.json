		"Heroes, monsters, battles, and journeys - for over a thousand years, elements of epic poetry shaped ideas of what a good story should be. But with the modern age, the novel replaced epic as the most culturally revered literary form. Students explore how the novel draws upon as well as rejects the epic tradition, and how the novel reflects what we mean by \"modernity\" itself. This course ranges from Anglo-Saxon epic to modern and contemporary novels. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: FYW."
