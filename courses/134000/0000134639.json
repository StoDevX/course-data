		"Disasters and crises loom large. They are not singular events. Their effects spiral starting where the crises occur and spiraling outward globally. This course examines disasters worldwide and anthropological approaches to studying them. This involves learning about disasters through various media, documentary film, written ethnography, and critical social theory. Studying disasters reveals much about scientific and institutional attempts to manage and control them and how power is articulated in disaster (mis)management. Offered annually."
