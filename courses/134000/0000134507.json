		"In this course students investigate the relationship between historical and emergent environmental decline and Christianity's scriptures, claims, traditions and practices. Students explore how variant ecotheological perspectives address the intersectional realities of gender, race and socio-economic status when responding to a number of contemporary environmental issues and whether Christianity might aid in the envisaging of future solutions. Offered annually. Prerequisite: BTS-B."
