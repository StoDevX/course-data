		"This seminar introduces students to the nature and development of Muslim societies in sub-Saharan Africa, from the earliest times to the present. Students also explore questions of authenticity and \"historical truth\" as they examine current debates on themes such as patterns of Islamization, \"African Islam,\" and Islam in Africa. Other themes include the invention of Muslim identities, expansion of Sufism, women in Islam, Islamic education, Islam and colonialism, as well as revivalism in Islam. Also counts toward Africa and the African Diaspora concentration. Offered annually."
