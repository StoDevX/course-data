		"Like the Swedish character Pippi Longstocking, who lives alone and can lift a horse above her head, the Nordic child is widely considered an autonomous being. Yet the child's autonomy is often at odds with their vulnerability. Through Scandinavian literature and film, this course considers questions such as: What is the child capable of and from what must they be protected? What is the difference between children and adults? And, what makes Nordic childhood particular? Offered periodically. Prerequisites: FYW or current registration."
