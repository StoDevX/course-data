		"Urban sociology investigates the complex interactions of human beings in cities and beyond. Topics include the changing relationship between people and place; social stratification along the lines of race/ethnicity, gender/sexuality, and class; and urbanism's importance in global political power and economics. Chicago will serve as an important case study for considering these social, political, and economic dynamics. Offered annually."
