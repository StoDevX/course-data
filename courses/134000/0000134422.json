		"Limnology is the study of inland freshwaters, which includes lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, streams, and wetlands. This course examines the physical, chemical, and biological drivers of freshwater ecology. Class periods will introduce students to the fundamental concepts and knowledge of limnology, while the laboratory exercises will provide hands-on experience studying freshwaters. This course will build upon fundamental concepts to examine real-world problems facing freshwater ecosystems (e.g. hydropower, invasive species, pollution, climate change). Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisite: BIO 261; or permission of instructor."
