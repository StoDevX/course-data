		"Today, countries from Uruguay to South Korea to the United States all proudly claim to be \"democracies.\" In this class, students investigate the dawn of democracy in ancient Athens to understand democracy's origins and what \"rule of the people\" meant to the Greeks--something radically different from modern political systems that claim the same title. Students read and discuss ancient sources (in English translation) and experience Athenian democracy for themselves through a historical role-immersion game. Offered periodically during Interim. Also counts toward ancient studies, Greek, and Latin majors."
