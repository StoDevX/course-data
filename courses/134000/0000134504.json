		"This course explores the long history of the French in North America and of Americans in France, focusing on how this history influenced ideas of race in America. Topics include 17th-century encounters between French missionaries and indigenous populations, Francophone cultures of Louisiana, and the experiences of African American expatriates in France. Coursework includes readings, critical analysis, research methods, and substantive projects. Taught in English. Offered periodically. May count toward the French major (see instructor)."
