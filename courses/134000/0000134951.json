		"Do multicultural church congregations foster the racial reconciliation found in the concept of Beloved Community made famous by Martin Luther King, Jr.? Or do they function to assimilate minority cultures into the dominant white American culture? In this course, students examine sociological and ethnographic evidence from Christian congregations involved in multicultural projects. They learn to read these projects as lived theological expressions and critically analyze them. Offered periodically. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies major and concentration. Prerequisites: BTS-B and FYW."
