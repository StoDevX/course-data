		"Memory is a fundamental part of human existence, but what do we currently know about the neurobiology that underlies this remarkable ability? In this seminar, students present and discuss recently published research that examines the neurobiology of learning and memory from molecular, cellular, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience perspectives. Offered periodically. Also counts toward neuroscience concentration. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230, and PSYCH 238 or NEURO 239."
