		"This course introduces some of the main theoretical approaches and some practical applications of environmental anthropology. Students examine cultural and social aspects of the human-environment interface, such as different belief and value systems relating to the environment, resource conflict and management, conservation and biodiversity, agriculture and food security, and the environmental justice movement. The course also addresses methods and problems of applying research in environmental anthropology to related development, conservation, and human rights issues. Counts toward sociology/anthropology and environmental studies major (natural science and social science emphases) and concentration when taught as Environmental Anthropology. Offered in the fall semester."
