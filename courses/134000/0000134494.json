		"This coure explores life, death, and entertainment in the ancient world, particularly Rome. We will focus especially on how and why people take part in sporting events and on how sport intersected with gender, social class, and economics. Topics include the history of sport, slavery and marginal groups, demography, gladiatorial events, and entertainment and politics. Our primary focus will be interpretation of ancient sources, but we will also evaluate modern views of ancient entertainment. Also counts toward the Ancient Studies major."
