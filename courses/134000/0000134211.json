		"This course combines job-shadowing, panel discussions, and a seminar. Students work with two different D.C.-area employers (primarily in government and advocacy sectors). Daily seminars analyze these vocational experiences as they relate to scholarship on political efficacy, motivation, and ethics. Students also receive an introduction to the breadth of career opportunities available in D.C. through panel discussions and networking. Offered annually during Interim. Apply through International and Off-Campus Studies."
