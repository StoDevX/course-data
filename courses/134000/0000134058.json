		"This course covers fundamental concepts of graph theory and their applications, including topics such as simple graphs and directed graphs, degree sequences, Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs, trees and spanning trees, matchings, networks and feasible flows, connectivity, and graph colorings. Other applications and algorithms may include greedy algorithms for minimum spanning trees, Pr√ºfer codes, Hall's Theorem, the Gale-Shapley Algorithm, Menger's Theorem, the Max-Cut/Min-Flow Theorem, the Committee Scheduling Problem, Kuratowski's Theorem, and Ramsey's Theorem. Prerequisites: MATH 244 or MATH 252."
