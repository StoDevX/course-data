		"This course takes students on an exciting journey back to the world of the ancient Romans, a land of republic and empire, oratory and elegy, brick and marble--and much more. Students explore ancient Roman society from an interdisciplinary perspective, analyzing its literature, art, and ideas in the light of their historical and cultural contexts. The course ranges far, both chronologically and geographically, from the Tiber River to the shores of Carthage to Hadrian's Wall. Offered alternate years. Also counts toward ancient studies, Greek, and Latin majors."
