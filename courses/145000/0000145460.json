		"A theatrical play is a unique form of literature that has as much to do with music as it does with words. Using dialogue as the primary driver of story and character, this class will introduce students to various dramatic techniques that will help them write short plays that engage the audience and lead to a satisfying theatrical experience. Students will be encouraged to draw characters and conflicts from their own lives and take full advantage of their unique worlds to give their work authenticity. Weekly playwriting exercises will be supported by reading and analyzing a new play every week. These will be mostly contemporary plays and will tie in thematically to the exercises. Students will take turns breaking down different aspects of the play be it plot, subtext, punctuation, a playwright's history, to more extrinsic aspects of the theatre such as conceptualizing costumes, imagining the play in a site-specific setting, or designing a poster for a new production. In addition, students will be responsible for writing one theatre review of a play (possibly a St. Olaf production), as well as writing a final paper that will be tailored to their chosen field of interest relating to theatre."
