		"Students in this course will become experts at communicating about the environment. We will interpret, critique, and create texts (written, oral, digital) about major environmental issues, including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and environmental (in)justice. Students in the course will become comfortable placing texts within critical discourses (e.g., Prometheanism vs. sustainable development) and creating their own public-facing, data-driven texts addressing environmental issues. Class time will include workshops on quantitative and qualitative skills for communicating about environmental data. Fulfills either NS or SS attributes of the Environmental Studies major or concentration. Prerequisite: ENVST 137 or ENCON 111."
