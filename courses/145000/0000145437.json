		"Friendship is among the most foundational concepts in nearly every age and society, and yet it remains among the most mysterious. Today it commonly refers to people, nations, pets, businesses, and online avatars associated with people we may never have met. Why is friendship so resonant across temporal and cultural contexts and yet so hard to define? Is friendship a preference for individual people or an obligation we have to each and every person we encounter? To what extent is friendship gendered? Does friendship play different roles in different cultures, and if so, how do we talk about intercultural friendships? In this seminar, we'll draw on literature, film, philosophy, journalism, and visual art in order to consider existing philosophies of friendship and to develop our own. Major writing assignments will include a rhetorical analysis and a research project on influential friendships and friendship communities."
