		"From Black Power to Black Lives Matter, from the Combahee River Collective to the Crunk Feminist Collective, the concept now known as intersectionality was first theorized by feminists of color in the 1970s and continues to provide a crucial lens for grappling with questions of identity, power, and social justice. In this seminar, we will think and write alongside intersectional writers and activists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Kimberlé Crenshaw, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde as we build more complex understandings of the relationships between gender, race, sexuality, class, and other aspects of identity. Through encounters with many types of texts--including poems, personal essays, scholarly articles, videos, manifestos, and social media posts--you'll sharpen your critical thinking, close reading, argumentation, and research skills. You will not only write about intersectionality, but also will practice intersectional methods--teasing out nuances, imagining new frameworks, and holding in mind conflicting ideas--that will allow you to grow as a writer and person. Assignments will include individual essays, a presentation in pairs, and a group podcast that discusses research-based, practical applications of intersectionality for everyday life, our campus community, and the wider culture."
