		"Human beings are social creatures. The connections we have with others shape our identities and enhance our sense of belonging in the world. In the digital age, more and more of us are connected via virtual communities, online networks of people who come together around a common interest, issue, or concern. This seminar will explore what it means to be a community, whether and how virtual communities are \"real\" communities, and what the opportunities and challenges present in life together online can teach us about what it means to be human together. During the semester students will investigate a particular online community and explore whether/how its status as a community connects its participants in meaningful ways."
