		"In this course, students read creative works written by immigrants to Minnesota, from nineteenth century arrivals from Nordic countries to contemporary works that reflect the diversity of recent immigrants to this state. Historical studies of immigration to Minnesota contextualize literary works. In this discussion-based course, students problematize the idea of a unifying \"immigrant experience,\" and instead explore how creative works render visible the unique challenges immigrants, and their communities, face. Offered periodically in the spring. Also counts toward the Nordic studies major and concentration. Prerequisite: WRIT120, WRIT 111, or equivalent."
