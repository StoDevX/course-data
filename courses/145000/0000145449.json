		"There is growing concern among policy experts and economists about the rate at which developing countries, especially those in Africa, have been accumulating debt in recent times. While debt build up is a global problem, the consequences of a debt crisis would be felt disproportionately by poor countries. A high debt-to-GDP ratio elevates the risk of growth collapse and may pose serious implications for job creation and poverty alleviation in developing economies. In this seminar, students explore the debt problem in developing economies with a focus on how resource endowment affects the relationship between public debt and economic growth. Texts will focus on resources for infrastructure deals, public debt, and economic growth. Students will read articles and write case studies."
