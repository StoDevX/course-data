		"This course will examine films created by women filmmakers since the Nouvelle Vague (late 1950s-present). Screenings of films from a variety of popular and \"high brow\" genres and accompanying critical readings will focus on a range of historical and contemporary questions, while also introducing theoretical approaches to film studies. Topics include: cinema and modernity; gender, race, sexuality, and social class; everyday life; culture and society; rural vs. urban experience; trauma. Students will develop their ability to critically analyze films, hone their French oral and written skills, and deepen their understanding of these issues through discussion, oral presentations, creative projects, analytical writing, and short readings. Taught in French. Prerequisite: minimum of one 250-level course."
