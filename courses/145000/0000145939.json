		"This course explores depictions of the city and urban space in American literature and film. We examine the city in relation to modernity, industry, architecture, space, identity, and community. In doing so, we address representations of class, race and gender. Novels may include Edith Wharton's Age of Innocence, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, John Dos Passos' The Manhattan Transfer, Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep, James Baldwin's If Beale Street Could Talk, Paul Auster's City of Glass, and Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex. Films may include Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Mick Jackson's L.A. Story, Guy Maddin's My Winnipeg, Sophia Coppoloa's Lost in Translation, and Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke."
