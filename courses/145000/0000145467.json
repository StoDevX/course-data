		"We will spend most of our lives at work. What is work? Is work a means to an end or should work be meaningful? Both? How is it different from play? What is the work of a college student? Using readings from sources in religious and philosophical traditions such as the Bible and Aristotle as well as contemporary texts, this class will encourage us to think wholistically about work. We will explore ideas such as work as an act of co-creation, the limits to work, and work as a calling -- all as a part of doing the work of a student."
