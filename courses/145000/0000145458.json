		"Blending the reading seminar and writing workshop, this course offers advanced practice in critical reading and writing with emphasis in the sciences. Students read and respond to popular feature stories in The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2022, creative writing, TED Talks, short documentaries, and scholarly essays. Topics include animal consciousness, dinosaurs, galaxies, the evolution of organs, the quest to preserve wild sounds, and the link between quantum mechanics and indigenous knowledge. Course activities first explore how writers and speakers communicate with multiple audiences, then students practice various communication strategies through personal narrative, information visualization, an explainer, and a researched feature story. Prerequisite: successful completion of First-Year Writing or Writing and Rhetoric."
