		"This course explores the problem of \"tradition\" by studying how contemporary poets and playwrights \"play\" with the literature of Renaissance England. Students study theories of authorship and interpretation before focusing on literature by authors such as John Donne, George Herbert, Queen Elizabeth I, Jen Bervin, Margaret Edison, Jay Wright, and Wallace Shawn. Thematic questions for the course include: What is literary tradition? What is the difference between literature and literary criticism? What authority do authors have over their work? Students read, write about, perform, and generate their own literary dialogues with Renaissance texts."
