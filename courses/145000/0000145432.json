	"description": [
		"Stories, whether they are classic fairy tales, superhero sagas, or the narratives we tell about our everyday lives, are full of recognizable hero and villain archetypes. Antiheroes, tricksters, witches, and warriors occur most recognizably in fantasy and science fiction, but we see them as well in real-world narratives about political parties, institutions, and interpersonal relationships. In this seminar, we will read, think, and write about the heroes and villains in our entertainment, news, and lives. Major assignments may include a profile essay, a researched essay, and a reflective essay."
