		"This course introduces students to the essential modeling techniques of formulation, implementation, validation, and analysis. Students engage in these areas by combining experiment, mathematical theory, statistics, and computation to better understand a wide variety of biological systems. Offered annually in the spring semester. Also counts toward neuroscience, public health studies, and mathematical biology concentrations. Prerequisite: MATH 126 or MATH 128, and familiarity with R programming (BIO 150 or STAT 212 or CS 125 or equivalent programming experience)."
