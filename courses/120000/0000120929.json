		"This course explores the social construction and function of sex and gender in ancient Greece and Rome. It uses both literature and visual art to analyze the role of sexuality in everyday society and in the lives of several of the more famous figures from antiquity. Readings also include modern histories and theories of sexuality, especially those that investigate the influence of the Greeks and Romans on modern conceptions of sexuality. Offered in alternate years. Counts toward Ancient Studies, Classics, Greek, Latin, and Women's and Gender Studies majors and Women's and Gender Studies concentration."
