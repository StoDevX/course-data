Readings also include modern histories and theories of sexuality, especially those that investigate the influence of the Greeks and Romans on modern conceptions of sexuality. Offered in alternate years. Counts toward Ancient Studies, Classics, Greek, Latin, and Women's and Gender Studies majors and Women's and Gender Studies concentration."
