These are the sorts of questions students explore as they navigate the basic systems that provide circulation, ventilation, movement, digestion, and waste removal. Students look at how these processes are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts, in dark, deep oceans, and places in between.

Accusations of witchcraft, moreover, have also historically been employed to rob others of power. Witchcraft and magic are implicated in social, economic, and political histories, and are heavily tied into the social construction of gender and the history of women.

This seminar explores the history of media and misinformation through the Cold War era, a period of conflict between geopolitical rivals, but also an ongoing contest of ideology, belief, propaganda, and rumor. We will explore critical moments when governments, the press, and the culture industry have leveraged media and misinformation to inform, deceive, divide, or shape public opinion. Students will develop as writers by analyzing evidence and creating argumentative ""op-eds"" that grapple with big ideas and engage various audiences in some of our society's most pressing problems. We will find that the histories of misinformation and the Cold War are deeply entwined and crucial for understanding our own relationship to media, politics, and each other.","17","","WRR","0000036257","G","","Patrick Wilz","0/0","S","100","18","Top: The Misinformation Age","Section topic: The Misinformation Age: Media, Culture, and the Public from the;Cold War to the Present","120","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '13:50', 'location': 'HH 433', 'start': '12:55'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '13:50', 'location': 'HH 433', 'start': '12:55'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '13:50', 'location': 'HH 433', 'start': '12:55'}","False","False","G","1","0/0","","O","20231","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2023"

In our final unit, we will closely examine struggles faced by students at St. Olaf in order to explore how games might even make our lives better. Ultimately, we will discover how games can teach us to write more effectively and how writing papers can help us create better games.","18","","WRR","0000036257","M","","Jennifer Shaiman","0/0","S","100","18","Top: What Games Teach Us","Section topic: What Games Teach Us","120","{'day': 'Tu', 'end': '11:00', 'location': 'RML 525', 'start': '09:35'};{'day': 'Th', 'end': '10:50', 'location': 'RML 525', 'start': '09:30'}","False","False","M","1","0/0","","C","20231","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2023"

In Caste, her provocative critique of race in American society, Isabel Wilkerson uses multiple stories and personal experience to argue that caste is a code buried beneath the surface of race relations in the U.S. That code uses notions of heredity, group purity, stigma, and enforcement through terror in ways similar to the Hindu caste system's suppression of the Dalits (the Untouchables) and Nazi Germany's scapegoating of the Jews. Does this explanation of social superiority and inferiority hold up against theories of economic competition and the nature of prejudice? Readings include Wilkerson's Caste, Marcus Zusak's The Book Thief, and either Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger or John Okada's No-No Boy.

In this seminar, we'll explore several avenues related to time including the roots of ""being on time"" tied to the advent of America's railway system, the vinyl record and CD shaping the nature and length of music, social media's influence on how we ""pass the time"", the role of smart and analog timekeeping devices, and how time has irrevocably evolved for many during the Covid pandemic.

Language--spoken, signed, and written--may be our most important tool for influencing others and constructing ourselves. This seminar is designed for students interested in the phenomenon of human language: its mutability, its persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we may address include: what's in a name? why do we lie? what words convey apology? how does language matter in our campus community? Readings in non-fiction and drama support class discussions of those questions and also model different writing ""moves."" During our study of language in drama, the class will also attend a production of the play we are studying. Students synthesize reading and viewing assignments, discussion, personal experience, and the results of their inquisitive research to write in several modes and genres. The writing process for these assignments integrates substantial time for workshops of drafts and students' reflections on their own rhetorical practices and development.","18","","WRR","0000036257","P","","Karen E.

Going a step further: how can reading and writing lead us to deeper insights about the nature of health itself, including the health of an individual, a group, or even a society? And how do processes of research and reflection inform the daily choices of readers, writers, and medical practitioners? As we explore a range of genres in this course, from memoir and drama to journalism and a documentary film, we'll ask how literature and medicine can interact to teach us about observing details, setting priorities, and listening in ethical ways. By working on three sequenced portfolio collections of writing during the semester, each student will first hone their own authorial voice, before learning to engage with one other writer on a key medical debate, and finally hosting a research conversation between multiple cited sources.","14","","WRR","0000036257","K","","Nancy Simpson-Younger","0/0","S","100","18","Top: Literature and Medicine","Section topic: Literature and Medicine","120","{'day': 'Tu', 'end': '09:25', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '08:00'};{'day': 'Th', 'end': '09:20', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '08:00'}","False","False","K","1","0/0","","O","20231","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2023"

Thus, while the class considers the ways that European thinkers have developed a dominant discursive context for thinking about sexuality and gender difference in the West and the academy, students learn to center the thinking of queer-of-color critics and the Global South as a site of critical knowledge making.

We will practice close reading through class discussions, personal essays, reflections, and short audio-visual responses while engaging in a relational examination of how contemporary memoirs, essays, short fictions, and other narratives show what it means to have a body, what it means to have a disfigured, dying, or diseased body, and how these different conditions are formally and thematically represented across genres and media. It centers how writers narrate embodied experiences, craft alternative spaces of kinship and belonging, love and acceptance, against crushing normative social values. To develop as writers, students will be expected to engage in close reading, to write critically, and to develop their skills by engaging in regular peer review of each other's writing (understanding writing as a process that improves through collaboration), and finally by composing a final paper or creative project on a course theme that inspires you. We'll read writing by Lucy Grealy, Jamaica Kincaid, James Baldwin, and Gloria Anzaldúa. This seminar is ideal for students interested in feminism, queer and queer-of-color thinking, and comparative race studies.","9","","WRR","0000036257","Q","","Joseph Sepulveda Ortiz","","S","100","18","Top: Writing the Self/Body","Section topic: Writing the Self, Writing the Body","120","{'day': 'Tu', 'end': '14:45', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '13:20'};{'day': 'Th', 'end': '15:35', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '14:15'}","False","False","Q","1","","","O","20231","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2023"
