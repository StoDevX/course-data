To this end, we will discuss sociological studies about how we express ourselves in the spaces we inhabit, consider some of the philosophical connections between domestic spaces and the people we have the capacity to become, and theorize how and why a house becomes described as “haunted.” To help us investigate these topics thoughtfully, we will draw from literary nonfiction, history, sociology, literary criticism, philosophy, and journalism. These readings will come from both traditional academic sources as well as popular ones. Essays will include a close reading of a room, a researched argument about a supposedly haunted house, and a response to a philosophical argument about the power of spaces to shape who we are.","15","","","","","Jennifer Shaiman","0/0","S","100","18","First-Year Writing","Section topic: Finding Home.","111","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '08:55', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '08:00'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '08:55', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '08:00'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '08:55', 'location': 'RML 520', 'start': '08:00'}","False","False","R","1","0/0","","C","20181","","Research","2018"

But it also tasks humans with being responsible for rightly relating to material things, whether one’s own body or creation itself. This course will explore the diverse ways the Bible guides its reader into caring about these materially-rooted relationships. In short, we will read the Bible economically, understanding that economics means “the law of the household” that stresses the importance of just and sustaining practices towards all material things. To do so, we will look at issues such as wealth, sex, farming, gender relations, diet, and private property. We will reflect on the economic concerns of a diverse biblical world rooted in an agrarian economy, tracing the recurrence of themes such as oppression, idolatry, and poverty as problematic features of how humans relate to the material world.","17","","","","","Peder J.
