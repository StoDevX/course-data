			"In this century of institutional development, national expansion, and sectional conflict, Americans continued to define a national identity. Students probe the ways in which region, religion, race, ethnicity, and gender inform individual and group contributions to the conversation. They also analyze how geographical expansion and ideas of progress influenced different visions and versions of America. Topics and texts range from Transcendentalist writers, the Second Great Awakening, and Black Elk Speaks to landscape painting and Western photography. Prerequisite: American Conversations 101.

			"This introductory-level course is part of a two-course sequence that encourages students to assess and shape their personal relationship to mass media. Its premise is that we are all, to some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media products and services rather than conscientious and socially-minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts towards American studies major and film studies concentration."

Prerequisites: Mathematics 120 or equivalent and Physics 124. Offered annually in the spring semester."

Much of this study is defined by changes in social and cultural history, with an emphasis on local and micro-histories. Students will produce a substantial research paper, based on primary sources and focused on a theme or problem related to histories of everyday life. Seniors are welcome.

In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives.

Students attend lectures plus one 3-hour laboratory/discussion per week. Offered each semester."

			"The course examines the historical and cultural context of public education in the United States and the role that race, class, and gender have played in framing the experience we call \"public education.\" Students explore the multicultural imperative that emerged from the school reform movements of the 1980s and 1990s. The initial work of James A. Banks and his five dimensions of multicultural education (content integration, the knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, an equity pedagogy, and an empowering school culture and social structure) serve as the conceptual model for the course. Essential questions for the course include: To what extent has this movement transformed public school curricula and pedagogical practices? In what ways have multicultural education and critical pedagogy successfully addressed issues of inequity in public education? In society? What might a new model for the 21st century look like?"

In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts towards American studies major and film studies concentration."
