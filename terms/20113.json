At the same time, the course attends to the economic, religious, political, and social forces that have affected the development of dance in the United States. Prerequisite: Dance 100 Introduction to Dance or permission of instructor. Ticket/transportation fee required. Offered annually in the spring semester. Counts towards ARMS and American studies majors and ARMS concentration."

The unifying theme is \"vocation,\" understood as a lived experience shaped by the values and expectations of practitioner, profession, and society, and manifested in various ways. Students examine scientific, cultural, institutional, ethical, and personal factors influencing the development of physicians and their practice in specific historical contexts. Offered periodically.

In Filmmakers/Film Theorists we will consider these questions by focusing on film artists who also write film criticism or theory. Some case studies that may be explored include: the American, Soviet, and French avant-garde; the European New Waves; the Dogme '95 collective; and filmmakers Pier Paolo Pasolini, Agnes Varda, and Robert Bresson.
