Its premise is that we are all, to some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media products and services rather than conscientious and socially-minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts towards American studies major and film studies concentration."

			"This is an introductory course for the liberal arts. Students learn study design principles and develop statistical literacy and reasoning. They learn to describe distributions, assess if known distributions fit their data, estimate population values with confidence intervals, and assess statistical significance with hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-square, z-, and t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression). In addition to lectures, there is a weekly computer lab. Not recommended for students who have completed a term of calculus. STAT 110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics, and students should not take more than one; they all can serve as a prerequisite for further courses. Offered each semester."

			"370A American Revolution: History and Historians - Professor Hahn - Many American historians would argue that the American Revolution was the defining event in United States history. Take away the colonists' rebellion and hard-fought separation from Great Britain and what is left is a country devoid of much of its political and cultural character. The problem, as John Adams recognized, is that the Revolution, then as now, meant different things to different people, making it a difficult subject about which to write. As a result, generations of historians have interpreted the origins and consequences of the Revolution in a variety of creative and contradictory ways. The aim of this course is not only to examine the American Revolution's key events, but also to explore the various interpretations of its origins and consequences. Students will read from a diverse body of literature derived from several scholarly traditions, addressing questions such as: How radical was the revolution? Who made the Revolution happen? Who benefited most? Why did some refuse to support it? Why 1776? As we will see, the debates surrounding such questions remain heated and contested to this day, proof positive of the Revolution's enduring legacy. What we may find is that the Revolution's final chapter, in some sense, has yet to be written.",

			"370B Civil Rights - Professor Fitzgerald - From Segregation to Civil Rights, this course examines the scholarly literature on the origins and outcome of the Civil Rights movement, basically 1900 to the 1970s, from the origins of Jim Crow to its overthrow. The primary focus will be on the South, and how southern racial issues played out before the nation and the world, particularly via the media. The class will culminate with an original research paper drawing on the range of primary sources available. Relevant coursework on African-American history, the Civil War era, recent US history, or lynching is strongly recommended."

			"History 210 examines the experience of occupation, collaboration, and resistance in France during World War II, an individually and nationally painful episode for the French. During four years of hardship and uncertainty, both the Vichy regime and French resistance groups attempted to remake France by developing competing visions of the nation. Upon the Liberation of Paris, a victorious Charles de Gaulle spoke of a nation of resisters \"from the first hour.\" The historical record and contested nature of French national memory, however, make clear that the truth is more complex. In this course we'll use both primary and secondary sources to examine the perspectives of the historical actors and the interpretations of historical scholars. We'll also consider the distinctive ways in which literature and film shape an understanding of French experience during the war years. Finally, since this course is a Majors Seminar (M-sem), we'll pay particular attention to the way historians do their work."

			"\"Ya say you want a revolution? Well...\" Students in this class will not be examining Chevrolet's ad campaign ad campaign for its new line of cars, but will be immersing themselves in one transformative year: 1968. We will look at the Tet offensive and its impact on the Vietnam War, which affected the presidential campaigns; we'll examine the protesting of the Miss America pageant, where feminists crowned a sheep; we'll try to understand why two greatly influential American leaders who could bring people together - Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy - were assassinated; we'll read about the Columbia University protests, where black students threw the white protesters out of \"their\" occupied building. We'll learn more about Black Power, the summer Olympics, George Wallace's segregationist \"law and order\" campaign and how that helped Richard Nixon win election. We'll listen to songs, watch films, read essays. 1968 is a year in a time period that is mythologized history, and we'll think hard about how and why the era is mythologized, as we do our own exploration about that year. All students will do a final project in the last few weeks of the term, taking up some issue after 1968 to see the continuities and differences."

Multi-ethnic peoples have always populated the massive geographic area that comes to be known as \"Russia.\" How did the state at various times in history seek to integrate, assimilate or rule over ethnic and religious minorities? What were the strategies and practices of imperial rule under the Romanov monarchy? How and why did policies of assimilation alternate with policies of tolerance, and why were these policies unevenly applied? How did the Soviet project define national identity? We will consider these questions over a broad sweep of history with the goal of identifying analytical categories and models that are appropriate to the Russian context. The course will also introduce key theoretical texts on national identity and imperialism. We will interrogate these theories and test them against the Russian version of colonial rule - a colonialism that differed from European models yet, some would argue, has persisted to this day. Finally, we will consider (to the extent possible) the perspective of colonized peoples and what an alternative narrative history of Russian expansion might look like \"from below.\"",

			"370A American Revolution: History and Historians - Professor Hahn - Many American historians would argue that the American Revolution was the defining event in United States history. Take away the colonists' rebellion and hard-fought separation from Great Britain and what is left is a country devoid of much of its political and cultural character. The problem, as John Adams recognized, is that the Revolution, then as now, meant different things to different people, making it a difficult subject about which to write. As a result, generations of historians have interpreted the origins and consequences of the Revolution in a variety of creative and contradictory ways. The aim of this course is not only to examine the American Revolution's key events, but also to explore the various interpretations of its origins and consequences. Students will read from a diverse body of literature derived from several scholarly traditions, addressing questions such as: How radical was the revolution? Who made the Revolution happen? Who benefited most? Why did some refuse to support it? Why 1776? As we will see, the debates surrounding such questions remain heated and contested to this day, proof positive of the Revolution's enduring legacy. What we may find is that the Revolution's final chapter, in some sense, has yet to be written.",

The class will culminate with an original research paper drawing on the range of primary sources available. Relevant coursework on African-American history, the Civil War era, recent US history, or lynching is strongly recommended."

How do we begin to resolve such impasses? Most work in environmental studies -- and nearly all that is natural science and social science based -- focuses on exterior or objective perspectives, examining structures such as individual subjects or ecosystems or political and economic systems. This seminar will consider contested spaces and the values that underlie arguments about such spaces by also focusing on interior perspectives, the role of emotion, beauty, ideas about the self, cultural mores, and so for th.

Students are expected to communicate clarity of understanding both orally and in writing. Non-majors are invited to take this course, though its primary focus is a comprehensive preparation for further theater studies. Offered each semester."

Through looking at analytical texts surrounding their experiences, this course will challenge popular images of African crises and international interventions. How are issues as diverse as conflict, poverty, hunger, disease, disablement, migration, reproduction and sexuality lived through the day-to-day experiences of individuals? How do gender, age, class, and ethnicity stratify the forms suffering take? And how do local responses, popular representations, and global political decision-making reflect, contest, and reinforce particular hierarchies of power?"
