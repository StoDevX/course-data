Topics are drawn from recent texts and current periodic literature, and participants will recognize many of the themes from coverage in the media. Because most environmental problems involve issues beyond the sciences, the class examines the economic, political, and ethical dimensions of environmental questions and environmental decision-making. Offered each semester."

Class activities increase students' awareness of a healthy diet, help students evaluate nutrition behaviors, and facilitate a nutritionally sound lifestyle. Prerequisite: High school biology and chemistry strongly recommended. Offered annually during interim and in the spring semester."

Headlines worldwide draw attention to transnational migration. This course covers explanations of entry control policy, integration and citizenship policy, and the political activities of migrants in the wealthy democracies. Alternative arguments emphasizing the role of economic interests, sovereignty, national identity, and gender are introduced. This course can count for comparative or international relations.

In the later medieval world, the course focuses on the rise of the city, on the spirituality of the Franciscan and Dominican orders, and on a new class of patrons who, fueled by the new economy of Europe, commissioned art on a larger scale than ever before. The course ends with a discussion of what the Gothic came to mean in the 19th century, as European nations solidified and industrialized. Offered every three years."

Emphasis is on intersections between literature and intellectual and social history: How well do literary sources reflect actual social practice? How does literary practice shape experience to create works of art? Offered periodically."
