The lens of the geographer focuses on the spatial distribution of phenomena over the surface of the earth, asking the questions \"where?\" and \"why there?\". The practices and skills of geography are used to investigate a variety of issues in the Middle East, including environmental problems, the culture and management of sacred places, and the reasons for war and the need for peace. Counts toward environmental studies major (social science track)."
