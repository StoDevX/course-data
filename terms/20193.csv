This section will explore how different biblical texts deal with these questions. It will also examine how diverse religious communities, reading the Bible from different cultural backgrounds, have interpreted biblical texts differently in constructing concepts of spiritual, superhuman, and non-corporeal beings. From biblical texts, we will discuss figures such as the heavenly court, the serpent and Watchers of Genesis, angelic visitors, the Adversary of Job, and angels, demons, and the devil seen in many New Testament texts. We will consider how the interpretation of these biblical texts has impacted post-biblical reflection on discernment, the importance of radical hospitality, witchcraft, and heresy.

Such experiences can leave us feeling uncertain about our futures, pointing us toward a question: how do we live well - that is, ethically, pragmatically, and hopefully - in the time of climate change? In this seminar, we will encounter and respond to essays, articles, films, and podcasts that explore what it means to live meaningfully during environmental uncertainty. Discussion will focus on the crossroads of climate change and topics like food, animal and nonhuman life, migration and diaspora, rewilding, and tourism. Additionally, students will develop their own writing and research through a place-based personal essay, an investigative essay, a digital media project, and a series of reading forums.
