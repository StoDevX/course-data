Coursework uses extended case studies and surveys topics such as professional and ethical responsibilities, risk, liability, intellectual property, privacy, and computer crime.

			"This introductory-level course is part of a two-course sequence that encourages students to assess and shape their personal relationship to mass media. Its premise is that we are all, to some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media projects and services rather than conscientious and socially-minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts towards American studies major and film studies concentration."

Much of this study is defined by changes in social and cultural history, with an emphasis on local and micro-histories.

			"This class explores social change in the U.S. from a number of different perspectives. Through historical analysis, theoretical readings, case studies, ethical reflection, and practical application, students investigate local and global problems and assess a range of approaches to bring about change. The paths to change this course examines include social entrepreneurship and innovation, grassroots development, community organizing, labor organizing, electoral politics, and policy advocacy. In addition to studying this broad landscape of social change, a major component of this course requires students to select, plan, and begin to carry out work on a community project that addresses a particular issue or problem. In this way, the course integrates a hand-on approach that encourages students to apply the analytical skills, practical tools, and organizational knowledge needed to cultivate change and engage fully as a citizen."

The course also considers Russia's relationships with the U.S.A., India, and China. There is also special attention on Russian/Norwegian energy relations in the Barents Sea. Prerequisite: Political Science 220 or 282. Offered annually."

How do gender, age, class, and ethnicity stratify the forms suffering take? And how do local responses, popular representations, and global political decision-making reflect, contest, and reinforce particular hierarchies of power?"

Peoples around the world create different realities through the ways they conceptualize experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do what they need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe and compare cultures and societies, focusing on different aspects such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion and values, economy and technology, cultural and social change. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs. Offered each semester.

			"This course examines the historical and cultural context of public education in the United States and the role that race, class, and gender have played in framing the experience we call \"public education.\" Students explore the multicultural imperative that emerged from the school reform movements of the 1980's and 1990's. The initial work of James A. Banks and his five dimensions of multicultural education (content integration, the knowledge construction process, prejudice reduction, an equity pedagogy, and an empowering school culture and social structure) serve as the conceptual model for the course. Essential questions for the course include: To what extent has this movement transformed public school curricula and pedagogical practices? In what ways have multicultural education and critical pedagogy successfully addressed issues of inequity in public education? In society? What might a new model for the 21st century look like?"

The texts of the course focus on a diversity of gendered identities by complicating the gender binary of \"man\" and \"woman.\" A consideration of gender separated from other identities is limiting; therefore, this course examines how gender is embedded with race, class, ability, sexual orientation, technology, religion, and/or nationality. May be repeated if topics are different. Prerequisite: FYW. Offered alterate years. Click on course title in the class and lab for more information about the course for that term."
