Writing during the period we often call the ""American Renaissance,"" some of these authors embraced the idea of literary independence for American writers, spiritual liberation form the religious institutions of the past, and the opportunity for unlimited development of the self. Others were concerned with the possibilities of freedom from slavery, from marriage, or from economic oppression. But all of these writers can be seen as entering into a conversation or debate with one another about the possibilities--or lack thereof--of attaining personal freedom and reforming American life. Among the texts we will consider: Emerson's Essays, Thoreau's Walden, Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life, Harriet Jacob's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Fuller's ""The Great Lawsuit,"" Melville's ""Bartleby the Scrivener"" and ""Benito Cereno,"" and Whitman's powtry.

Questions at the heart of thinking about Christian belief and social action include: How does Christian faith matter for one's actions in the world? What reasoning, sources, and argumentation from the Christian tradition are used as a critique for contemporary social issues? What role is Christian belief to play in the wider world? The course examines these questions through readings, class sessions, and each student's involvement in some form of civic engagement. Prerequisite: BTS-B.

"0000071878","1.0","0000000432","ENGL","This course focuses on a single novel: John Fowles's 1969 The French Lieutenant's Woman, a bestseller that's also highly allusive postmodernist classic. After reading Fowles's novel, we will spend the term following up on its many references to and relationships with other texts - leading us to a wide range of writers and artists including Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Thomas Hardy, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Roland Barthes, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Hayden White, and Harold Pinter (who wrote the rather quirky 1981 film adaptation of the novel). Returning to The French Lieutenant's Woman after exploring this larger context of history, fiction, art, criticism, and theory, we will ask: What difference does this body of knowledge make in our experience of the novel? How does intertextuality - a text's network of relationships with other texts - work? We will also consider postmodernism and its take on history and intertextuality, ideas about the 'ideal reader' or 'implied audience,' sex and sexuality in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, and a deep twentieth-century fascination with the Victorian era. Pre-requisite: GE 111 or its equivalent.","12","0/0","","Molly Westerman","","S","200","30","Auth, Eng: Fr.
