All three brilliantly explored and exploited the formal potential of this relative newcomer among literary genres, “the novel. “ We will read two or three works by each author (texts such as Austen’s Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion; Eliot's The Mill on the Floss and Middlemarch; Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and The Waves). We’ll trace continuity of themes and the development of new literary forms from the late eighteenth to early twentieth centuries, and explore issues of literary influence (how does Eliot re-vision Austen? How does Woolf both re-read and revise Austen and Eliot?). We’ll also explore the territory of contemporary literary criticism (in our own times), and undertake final projects putting secondary sources in conversation with your ideas.

While Europe never experienced the doomsday they feared, many other countries in Asia had to engage directly with them, changing their societies forever. To get a look at how these societies adapted and how such a devastating conquest could end up opening super-long-distance trade routes, this class will read, Chinese, Japanese, Muslim, and European travel writing as well as other primary and secondary sources that examine what life was like after the Mongols assembled the biggest land empire in human history.","23","","","","","Eric R.

Films are powerful vehicles for immersing us in worlds from different times and places, establishing a narrative, showing us change over time, and developing an interpretation. Yet over four decades after Sorlin’s observation, historian Robert Rosenstone, himself a champion of using film to study history, noted that historical films still “trouble and disturb” most professional historians. Why is the common focus on the past shared by film and historical study so problematic? In what ways do film and historical study complement each other to help us understand the past? These are the big questions that inspire this course. To begin answering these questions, History 299 focuses on ways in which film has portrayed seminal developments and events—and the contexts that produced them--in twentieth-century European history. We’ll “read” films as historical texts and explore their “meaning-making” capacity. We’ll treat some films as primary sources; we’ll examine others to consider how visions of the past bear upon the present—for instance, how a particular age or generation seeks a “useable” past. We’ll compare filmic and current scholarly interpretations of the past to understand better the role of each in shaping historical memory.
