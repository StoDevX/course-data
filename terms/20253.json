In this course, students learn about relationships between the brain and behavior and use neuroanatomical, physiological, and biochemical levels of analysis to understand basic behavioral processes and systems, including sensation, movement, emotion, sleep and arousal, hunger, motivation, learning, and psychopathology. Offered each semester. Also counts toward biology major and neuroscience concentration. Prerequisite: PSYCH 125 or BIO 123, BIO 227 or CH/BI 227."

Students learn current and/or historical evidence and methodology (e.g., microscopy, isolation procedures, and probes). Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Laboratory experiences provide opportunities for qualitative and quantitative observations of cellular structure and function. Students place their work in the context of current research through examination of relevant literature and formal presentations. Offered each semester. Counts toward \"cell biology\" core category. Prerequisites: CHEM 122, or CHEM 125, or CH/BI 125; BIO 150 is strongly preferred."

The course also attends to the economic, religious, political, and social forces that have affected the development of dance in the United States, particularly race, ethnicity, and gender and the intersection with other forms of structured inequality. Video examples supplement reading, live dance viewing, physical exploration, class lecture, mid-term and final exams, writing assignments, and discussion. No dance experience required.

They compare multiple perspectives on, and connections between the issues through sources including documentaries, podcasts, and news articles. Short writing assignments and oral presentations emphasize analysis of texts' strategic organization, argumentative structure, style, and layered voices. Advanced grammar review supports analytical tasks. Taught in German. A weekly small group discussion section led by a native German speaker is required. Offered annually in the spring semester. Prerequisite: GERM 232 or by placement test."

Below is a summary of options: EDUC 378: Multicultural Education in Hawaii; EDUC 379: Urban Education Seminar and Practicum; or pre-approved internships in multicultural schools. See Education Department faculty and website for advice and information. EDUC 382 is not a course. Rather it is a recording mechanism indicating St. Olaf students who have completed their multicultural education requirement. Students register for EDUC 382 during their professional semester.

To illustrate why non-scientists need to understand scientific practice the course also considers controversies such as global warming and intelligent design. Offered annually."

Students explore fundamental concepts, including iteration, recursion, object-oriented software design, algorithm efficiency, levels of naming, and computing ethics. Students apply these concepts daily in hands-on homework exercises relevant to fields in the arts, humanities (including digital humanities computations), social sciences, and natural sciences. Includes a team project applying CS to a chosen discipline. No prior experience with programming is expected or required. Offered each semester. One of CSCI 121, CSCI 125, or CSCI 251 counts toward applied linguistics concentration."

Finally, both particle and wave descriptions are shown to be necessary for discussing quantum mechanics and its application to atomic physics. Students attend lectures and one 2.5-hour laboratory per week. Offered annually in the spring semester. Does not count toward physics major. Prerequisites: PHYS 124 and either MATH 119 or MATH 120 or equivalent."

Through close readings of primary sources in English translation, students investigate what constitutes revolution as a theory and practice in modern China, and how a revolution begins, continues, declines, and rekindles.

Students begin with the romantic revolution of the late 18th century, traverse the wide 19th-century span of Queen Victoria's reign, and cross into the modernist era following the cataclysm of World War I. Within each era, students examine a literary manifesto, a revolutionary event, an epic poem, a novel, and the aesthetics of the period. The course emphasizes conversations across eras and striking moments of \"making it new.\" Offered periodically. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."

Focusing on identities and communities, students learn about racial formation and difference in U.S. and comparative cultural and historical contexts. How does race intersect with class, gender, nation, and sexuality to produce privileges and oppressions? Students survey the emergence of Ethnic Studies through literary texts including art, creative writing, film, music, popular culture, and/or the sciences to become acquainted with interdisciplinary approaches and how concerns for racial equity and social justice formed this academic field.

			"This course is an introduction to some of the central, interrelated concepts and questions of political theory. Some of the readings will be drawn from recognized classics in the field while others will arise from contemporary debates about political issues and cultural diversity within the U.S. The course pays considerable attention to historical shifts in political thought but is not designed to provide a chronology of the great Western political thinkers. Instead, this course aims to provoke and sustain a semester-long exploration of what it means to be a political actor -- that is, a citizen -- and what it means to think about politics. Offered annually."

			"Neuroethology is the study of how nervous systems generate natural behaviors in animals. The nervous system connects an animal with its environment, determining how an animal perceives, learns, and reacts to stimuli. This course explores the neural mechanisms underlying diverse behaviors - such as escape reflexes, locomotion, and communication - in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate species and based on an evolutionary framework. Lecture concepts are explored through laboratory experimentation and different forms of scientific communication. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. Offered in alternate years with BIO 386 (Animal Behavior). Prerequisite: MATH 120 or equivalent and one of the following: BIO 233, BIO 247, BIO 266, NEURO 239, or PSYCH 238 or permission of instructor."

We will examine the history of Spanish, Portuguese and French imperialism in the region through the eyes of the people who lived it: Indigenous commoners and nobles, enslaved and freed people, women and children, scientists and entrepreneurs. With a specific focus on the history of human interaction with the region's diverse ecologies and the development of capitalism, on colonial law and the history of race and gender, we will ask how colonial society took shape, how these empires sustained themselves and why they eventually collapsed. Students will gain an appreciation for Latin America's central role in the modern history of global interconnection and understand how the specific dynamics of imperialism established the foundation for Latin America's postcolonial history."

			"This course introduces students to literary journalism, a tradition of in-depth nonfiction writing that reveals society's untold stories. Together, students discuss genre-defining texts from Joan Didion to The New Yorker. Students follow a slow journalism model used by magazine editorial departments, practicing investigative newsgathering using databases, public records, visual media, and interviews. Through deep work with sentence-craft, they develop a publishable longform article (or several shorter, linked works) in an area of their particular interest. Offered periodically. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."

The chronology then slows and focuses primarily on the developments in the Middle East that have led to the current Palestinian Israeli crisis. Underlying this chronological structure, specific themes will be emphasized in each class, along with overarching themes like the roles of imperialism, nationalism, religion, and victimhood narratives.
