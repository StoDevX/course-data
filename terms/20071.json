Students look at how these are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts or in dark, deep oceans and places in between. In the weekly 3-hour lab, they conduct quantitative physiological measurements to assess functions such as temperature control, respiration rates, and salt and water balance.

The class also explores the use of classical myth in later literature and its manifestations in art, music, and drama from ancient to modern times. Offered annually."

Students learn about prenatal development, birth and the newborn, physical development, the infant-caregiver relationship, infant cognition, and language development. Students also consider evidence about childcare, early intervention, and the influence of media and interactive toys designed for very young children. Cross-cultural comparisons highlight issues of diversity. Prerequisite: Psychology 231, and 241. Offered most years."

Sports provide stories and images used to explain and evaluate these contexts and provide a window into culture and society. This seminar considers ways in which sports may be understood as social constructs: Who plays sports, what happens to them, and why? Do money and power matter in sports? If so, how? How does \"playing games\" become formalized, institutionalized? What is the role of media in sports? Or religion? Or government? Students will discuss and produce position papers on various issues relating to sports in society."

Prerequisite: FYW or equivalent. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Middle Ages focuses upon Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature, including the Beowulf poet, Chaucer, Julian of Norwich, and Malory, in the context of emerging ideas such as heroism, the role of women, and the relationship between secular society and the Church. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Renaissance examines radical literary changes in English literature, as they occur in Spenser, Shakespeare, Lanyer, Donne, and Milton, in such contexts as the Protestant Reformation and strife over Puritanism, court politics under Elizabeth and James, and the English Civil War. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Age of Englightenment focuses upon neoclassical poetry and satire and the emergence of the novel. Writers such as Dryden, Behn, Swift, Pope, and Fielding are read in the context of political and social revolutions, the African slave trade, and the growth of modern capitalism. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Romantic Period considers the outburst of literary creativity in such poets as Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats and such prose writers as Wollstonecraft, Scott, Austen, and Mary Shelley, in the context of revolutionary politics, encounters with nature and the rise of industrialized, consumer capitalism. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Victorian Period, a time of British political and cultural dominance, examines the work of such writers as Tennyson, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Dickens, and the Brontës, in the context of scientific, industrial and colonial growth, religious skepticism, and challenges to class and gender inequalities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Modern British Literature focuses on the literature reflecting modern turbulence, innovation, and alienation, as in Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, and Eliot, in the context of World War, social and economic crises, and radical artistic experimentalism."

Only one 0.25 course can be applied toward the two 0.25 course Physical Activity (PHA) graduation requirement. In addition, an intercollegiate physical education (0.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose of earning a credit toward the 35 full course credits requirement for graduation. It can only be used once as one- half of the two-course PHA requirement. Fall: varsity football, soccer, cross-country, women's volleyball. Spring Semester: remainder of intercollegiate sports. Participants in club sports are not eligible. Students must register for the course during the competitive season."
