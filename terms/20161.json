			"The Bible and Salvation Like the Philippian jailer, who cries out for salvation while his life crumbles around him, people for millennia have turned to the God of scripture for hope in the midst of brokenness. From images of personal healing to cosmic renewal, the Bible employs a surprising variety of metaphors to speak of God’s care and faithfulness toward God’s creation and covenant people. Employing both literary and historical approaches to reading, we will explore the rich diversity of biblical images of salvation. We will also delve into ways select theologians, artists, and filmmakers have utilized these biblical motifs to address specific cultures and contexts, with an eye toward exploring metaphors of salvation appropriate to our contemporary situations."

			"Reading the Bible for Love and Justice This course traces the twin themes of justice and love in the Bible. Some of the questions we’ll ask include: How do conceptions of divine love and justice change over the course of the Bible’s history? What kinds of justice and love are envisioned for human communities? How do different contexts, such as family, clan and community, national and international relations, affect biblical perspectives on justice? Where do we see biblical writers wrestling with problems posed by the apparent lack of justice? Can there be love without justice, or justice without love? A major focus of the course will be on the ways contemporary reading communities address lingering problems caused by unjust uses of the Bible, for example, in questions of gender, race, and power. We will also ask whether the Bible can continue to be a resource for reflecting on justice in the modern world, and if so, how."

In this section of Religion 121 we will study the Bibles of Judaism and Christianity together with scriptures of other religious traditions. We will consider the following questions: What is scripture? What kinds of literature are found in scriptures? What kinds of questions do scriptures address? How are scriptures used by religious people around the world? What is the relevance of scripture in the 21st century? We will carefully read and discuss selections from the Hebrew Bible of Judaism, the Old and New Testaments of Christianity, the Qur’an of Islam, the Vedas and other sacred texts of Hinduism, various Buddhist sutras, and Native American stories."

			"The Bible and Salvation Like the Philippian jailer, who cries out for salvation while his life crumbles around him, people for millennia have turned to the God of scripture for hope in the midst of brokenness. From images of personal healing to cosmic renewal, the Bible employs a surprising variety of metaphors to speak of God’s care and faithfulness toward God’s creation and covenant people. Employing both literary and historical approaches to reading, we will explore the rich diversity of biblical images of salvation. We will also delve into ways select theologians, artists, and filmmakers have utilized these biblical motifs to address specific cultures and contexts, with an eye toward exploring metaphors of salvation appropriate to our contemporary situations."

Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions. Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment.

In this section of Religion 121 we will study the Bibles of Judaism and Christianity together with scriptures of other religious traditions. We will consider the following questions: What is scripture? What kinds of literature are found in scriptures? What kinds of questions do scriptures address? How are scriptures used by religious people around the world? What is the relevance of scripture in the 21st century? We will carefully read and discuss selections from the Hebrew Bible of Judaism, the Old and New Testaments of Christianity, the Qur’an of Islam, the Vedas and other sacred texts of Hinduism, various Buddhist sutras, and Native American stories."

Biblical stories and themes have been a central source for filmmakers from the very beginning of the medium. What happens to those stories and themes in the process? What does the process of filmmaking teach us about how the Biblical authors may have brought their stories to life in their time? How do films illuminate the Biblical text, and how are contemporary perspectives, values, and prejudices reflected in the filmmakers' work? The balcony is open. Please note that the films will be screened outside of class; there will be a weekly scheduled screening, and the films will be available on library reserve for those unable to attend."

			"Call and Response in Biblical Traditions For better or worse religious persons throughout history have acted out of a sense of divine calling. As in the biblical texts humans today migrate and mobilize, associate and separate, build and destroy in effort to respond to God. This section explores the tension of these lived realities by asking: 1) What authenticates calling in the Bible? 2) Who is called, and to whom? 3) For what purposes are persons called? Specifically examining the biblical underpinnings of Protestant renderings of vocation we will address these questions by attending to the relationship between self, God and neighbor in the texts and in their contemporary reception and application. Our study will be informed by consideration of four major themes related to vocation: work, family, the environment and political engagement."

			"The Bible, Angels and Demons How should interpreters of the biblical text make sense of references to supernatural beings like angels and demons? In what sense are they supposed to be real? How do they relate to the divine? What is their relationship with evil? Are there evil angels in the Bible and if so, where do they come from? This section will explore how different biblical texts deal with these questions. It will also examine how diverse religious communities, reading the Bible from different cultural backgrounds, have interpreted biblical texts differently in constructing concepts of spiritual, superhuman, and non-corporeal beings. From biblical texts, we will discuss figures such as the heavenly court, the serpent and Watchers of Genesis, angelic visitors, the Adversary of Job, and angels, demons, and the devil seen in many New Testament texts. We will consider how the interpretation of these biblical texts has impacted post-biblical reflection on discernment, the importance of radical hospitality, witchcraft, and heresy. In addition to the biblical text, students will work with historical writings, film, literary fiction, and traditions of scientific skepticism."

			"\"Nature\" and the Biblical Traditions This section, focused on ecological themes and experiences, considers how different interpretations of the Bible have influenced (positively and negatively) conceptions of responsibility to and for the natural world. What is the relationship between “human nature” and the \"natural\" world? How do encounters with wildness and wilderness shape dispositions of gratitude, joy, and wonder? What is the value or significance of the more-than-human world? How should we deliberate about questions of wildlife management, endangered species, wilderness conservation, or climate policies? We will pair close readings of the Bible with selections from the tradition of nature writing, an interdisciplinary exercise which will allow us to address these questions of historical and on-going significance."

Students acquire a greater understanding of the entrepreneurial process: a process of opportunity recognition, resource marshaling, and team building driven by communication, creativity, and leadership. Discussions focus on the relationship of liberal arts disciplines to the entrepreneur, the role of entrepreneur in society and history, the risks and rewards of entrepreneurship, and the elements of the entrepreneurial behavior. Study concentrates on the entrepreneurial process from idea creation to ultimate business or other organizational activity. A leadership theme permeates these discussions. A variety of instructional techniques are used including group projects, guest presenters, and practicing entrepreneurs attending the class. Offered annually."

			"Telling Stories About Climate Change. The most recent report from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) doesn’t pull any punches. The globe continues to warm, ice continues to melt at an alarming pace, and the seas continue to rise. Climate change is already happening. Yet, according to a 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center, only 41% of Americans cited climate change as a major threat. So what gives? Why aren’t people getting the message? Are we delivering it wrong? Do we need more stories and better storytellers? This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? We’ll frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels). In class, students write responses to assigned reading or films, work in small writing groups to give and receive feedback, and work on exercises that take up a certain element covered in our writing handbook. Additional writing assignments will include a personal essay, analysis essay, a research essay, short blog entries, a manifesto, and more."

			"Language Matters. Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it “the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people’s minds.” Language—spoken, signed, and written—is one of the most important ways we influence others and construct ourselves. This seminar is designed for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we may address include: How have time, technology, and travel changed the English language? How do advertisers manipulate language? Why are “bad words” bad? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama show us how some authors have thought through these questions. We discuss these authors’ ideas and the “moves” they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience, and on the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of your drafts."

			"The recent economic downturn—what many have called a collapse—has raised concerns regarding the financial health of future generations. It is now widely accepted that the potential for younger Americans to do better than previous generations—the narrative of social mobility popularly understood as the American Dream—is no longer a reality. Instead, there is a growing consensus regarding the death of this dream and with it the very possibility to improve one’s economic, social, and cultural condition. It seems that rather than progressing toward a healthy democracy, the United States has spiraled into a science fiction reality where the media controls our thinking, politics is governed by self-interest, and corporations are powerful enough to hire private armies to impose their will around the globe. This seminar centers on twentieth century American culture, particularly as it relates to issues of historical progress, national identity, cultural change, and aesthetic experimentation. The main question we will address is “What has happened to the American Dream?” In addition to literature, we will also read some philosophical and political texts. Requirements will include short writing assignments, a mid-term paper, and a final paper. Some of the texts we will discuss include The Yellow Wallpaper, as well as films like There Will Be Blood, The Corporation, Revolutionary Road, andFight Club."

It is now widely accepted that the potential for younger Americans to do better than previous generations—the narrative of social mobility popularly understood as the American Dream—is no longer a reality. Instead, there is a growing consensus regarding the death of this dream and with it the very possibility to improve one’s economic, social, and cultural condition. It seems that rather than progressing toward a healthy democracy, the United States has spiraled into a science fiction reality where the media controls our thinking, politics is governed by self-interest, and corporations are powerful enough to hire private armies to impose their will around the globe. This seminar centers on twentieth century American culture, particularly as it relates to issues of historical progress, national identity, cultural change, and aesthetic experimentation. The main question we will address is “What has happened to the American Dream?” In addition to literature, we will also read some philosophical and political texts. Requirements will include short writing assignments, a mid-term paper, and a final paper. Some of the texts we will discuss include The Yellow Wallpaper, as well as films like There Will Be Blood, The Corporation, Revolutionary Road, andFight Club."

			"Can We Have Environmental Conversations, Please? Why is it so difficult to talk about or come to action on environmental issues, when it seems as if all humans should care in making progress on how we take care of the non-human world? Our seminar will examine the impediments and the possibilities for such conversations by looking at various matters: the environmental mantra “Think Globally, Act Locally”; the environmental framework of “Integral Ecology” and its relation to Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudago Si; food production in the United States; and St. Olaf College’s efforts to be good stewards of the non-human world. Students will read texts, research current events, watch films, and write essays in order to examine how we might promote environmental conversations. Intellectual play as well as experiential learning will be encouraged. (Open to Environmental Conversations students only.)"

			"Changing Our Minds. The United States is a country increasingly divided by issues of politics and religion. From immigration to abortion, from gun rights to bathroom rights, from vaccinations to marijuana use, many of us feel strongly about the issues that we care about. But from where, exactly, do our deepest held beliefs emerge? And how do we actually change the minds of others—or ourselves? In this seminar, we’ll use moral psychology to consider the roots of belief and the human capacity for change. Students will investigate an issue they care about through a variety of lenses: personal reflection, research, argument/debate, and interview/immersion with an “other” viewpoint. Ultimately students will try to convince their classmates—and themselves—to see the world in a more complex light."

Thinking and writing about the trickster will help us discover an important part of ourselves as humans. We will read, discuss, and write about narratives and other discourses dealing with the trickster. These will include folktales, epic and fictional tales, and theoretical works. We will reflect on these readings and respond to them in our writings, particularly by using these materials as sources of inspiration. Student writing will be discussed in conferences with the instructor. Texts include Beti's The Poor Christ of Bomba, Niane's Sundiata: An Epic of Old Mali, Radin's The Trickster, and Sanders' The Epic of Gilgamesh."

			"The Violence of Contemporary Life. This seminar will address an unsettling claim made by a number of recent American and Anglophone artists: that the seemingly mundane acts of self care and domesticity, of finding and maintaining work, of being with others on the other side of normal, entail daily encounters with direct and hidden forms of violence. From Margaret Atwood's dystopian fictions of authoritarian patriarchy and Claudia Rankine's harrowing, poetic account of living as an African-American citizen of the United States to Alex Gibney's documentary film on military torture Taxi to the Dark Side, and Kendrick Lamar's recent album about growing up in Compton, Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, we will scour contemporary works that approach everyday violence, particularly as it is inflected by questions of race, gender, and sexuality. We will ask: how do certain modes of representation depict, contest, promote, and even produce violence? And what do we mean by \"violence\" anyway? What counts and what does not? Writing assignments will begin with short blog posts, a close reading essay devoted to a single work, and a film review, and build toward a final research project."

			"On Being Human. What does it mean to be a human being in our modern world? Though all modern humans are biologically and genetically distinguishable in one unified species, technology and social attitudes challenge that unity. In this seminar, we will support each other in discussing and writing about a range of topics relevant to being a modern human (and a college student!). For example, new information about our species’ scandalous relationships with extinct relatives like Neanderthals will help us interpret how evolutionary history has resulted in today's globally distributed Homo sapiens. As another example, wide ranging perspectives on racism will help us navigate this difficult concept together and then launch students into investigations of other “isms.” Course resources draw from science and literature and are accessible to students of all interests and backgrounds. Assignments are designed to build research and writing skills over the semester and will include a personal essay, a research paper, and several response and summary assignments."

			"Fandom, Entertainment, and the Shaping of Fan Identity. Often, the things we like aid us in forming new connections with others who have similar interests. Does this mean the entertainment we consume informs who we become, or that it reflects who we already are? Fan practices, objects of fan devotion, and fans themselves are incredibly varied, yet they are the seeds that form subcultures and unite thousands. In this seminar, we will examine the history of fan culture as well as the current state of fandom. Students are welcome to introduce their own fandoms and fan experiences to written assignments and class discussions. Major assignments will include an investigative essay, a review, and a research paper. In addition to real-world examples of participatory culture, we will also consider depictions of fandom within fictional narratives that both critique and cater to fans, such as Ready Player One, Supernatural, and Galaxy Quest."

			"Personal Narratives. Students in this seminar work the whole semester to develop a single personal narrative, one made of shorter essays that develop their skill at writing description, analysis, and argumentation. For the short essays, for example, they develop statements that draw on their memories from childhood, involving recollections of a place, person, and incidents. Ultimately, they produce seamless stories that integrate these accounts and incorporate an array of genres. In the course of writing a neighborhood biography or migrant or farm story, or an immigrant account or family secret, or a recession story, they also learn to do library research and gather information from interviews. Finally, after reading models of excellent writing produced by contemporary American authors who focus in their work on issues of American identity and after working regularly in peer groups, they develop a keen sense of their audience."

			"Race and Power. The presidential election of Barack Obama appeared to signal a new era of racial equality in the United States. However, race persists today as a system of power interlocked with class and gender as evidenced by the criminalization of black and brown communities and the fatal shootings of young men of color, as well as the ban on ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona, despite the curriculum's life-changing effects in students' lives. This seminar looks at texts related to these events and others in order to understand how race continues to hold force over our social realities. Students write short essays and a research paper to strengthen their writing processes while developing analytical language to name and interrogate race in the United States."

			"Exploring and Re-Imaging Place in the 21st Century. Place is much more than a set of geographic coordinates or physical location. When we talk about feeling out of place or feeling at home, we are invoking discourses regarding culture, race, gender, history, and politics. Place can be the Golden Gate Bridge, a web forum, Middle Earth, Yellowstone National Park, a video game, a shared memory, or a piece of art. Through discussion of literature and scholarly essays, we will examine what place means and how we give meaning to place and vice versa. We will explore the roles technology and a mobile lifestyle play in redefining our environments and how we behave in them. Major assignments may include personal narratives, research-driven profiles on place, reviews, and interactive digital projects that challenge or enhance our perception of particular places."

They learn to describe distributions, assess if known distributions fit their data, estimate population values with confidence intervals, and assess statistical significance with hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-square, z-, and t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression). In addition to lectures, there is a weekly computer lab. Not recommended for students who have completed a term of calculus. STAT 110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics, and students should not take more than one; they all can serve as a prerequisite for further courses. Offered each semester. Counts toward environment studies major (social science emphasis) and exercise science major."

This introductory course for theater majors introduces students to canonical texts and performances that have helped to define our field. Primary emphasis is on the text as a blueprint for production focusing on analysis, variety of interpretation, the changing nature of theater space, and our growing awareness of the changing nature of performance. Students are expected to communicate clarity of understanding both orally and in writing. Non-majors are invited to take this course, though its primary focus is a comprehensive preparation for further theater studies. Offered each semester."

Exploring various approaches, but emphasizing a psychoanalytic-Marxist methodology, we will analyze how pathology gets normalized in culture and how such pathologization obstructs or corrupts collective attempts at social justice. Stated differently, we will study how such pathologies arrest the development of social progress. Areas to be explored include madness, criminality, and politics. Texts and films/television series to be analyzed include Dexter, Batman, The Talented Mr. Ripley, True Detective (season one), and American Psycho. Prerequisite: FYW.

			"This course focuses on bodily experience and afterlives in and of literature from the fourteenth to the early seventeenth century. The “corpse” of the title refers to the human bodies in the texts we will study —bodies that may experience pleasure, suffer pain and even martyrdom, and ultimately decay, as the spirit experiences some kind of afterlife. However, despite conceptions of the afterlife, the dead remained an important presence for the living, as intercessors, apparitions, ghosts and saints. The “corpus” is the body of a text—a story that is revisited by artists over time, in an afterlife of its own, as Shakespeare re-writes Hamlet or The Revenger’s Tragedy is re-imagined by Alan Cox in a postmodern film. For the English major, this course counts as a Literary History course and a pre-1800 course. Prerequisite: FYW."

			"In this course we take a close look at the work of three writers who address the social challenges facing the United States during the turbulent interwar years. The dramatic consequences of the Great Depression only tell part of the story. America was also deeply affected by the aftershock of World War I, the rise of communism (and later fascism) in Europe, class struggles at home, women’s liberation, the great migration, urbanization, and modernization, which included revolutionary changes in both transportation and communication (modern journalism, the feature film and public radio broadcasting). In studying Steinbeck, Dos Passos and Agee, we will not only look at how the subject materials of their writings reflect these social changes, but also how the authors developed different -- and in some cases strikingly modern -- textual strategies to engage with this tumultuous era of American history. In addition to Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat, The Grapes of Wrath, and Cannery Row, Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy (The 42nd Parallel, 1919 and The Big Money) and Agee’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, students will read a variety of scholarly texts that situate these primary works in their aesthetic, cultural, social and historical context.

			"The Muslim world is perhaps the least understood or most misunderstood part of the world, among Americans. The Muslim world is seen as homogeneous, and the very name Muslim conjures up images of religious fanaticism and terrorism. Muslim women are imagined as burka clad beings living under perpetual suffering and silence inflicted on them by archaic religious and cultural traditions. This course will explore such perceptions from the perspective of writings by Muslim women. There is a longstanding tradition of writing by Muslim women in languages such as Urdu, Arabic, Turkish, Hausa, Swahili, French and English. With a focus on writings in English and some translations, we will discuss writers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Senegal, and the USA, in the context of Islam and ideologies such as Orientalism, Islamophobia, and Islamic feminism. Students will gain a good understanding of the ways Muslim women interpret their condition in the context of culture, religion, and gender. Prerequisite: FYW.

The novel as a form — with its narrative ability to move in and out of interior states, to create numerous plots and sub-plots – has been particularly suitable for capturing the near-dizzying relations of family members. To help us make better sense of the complex relations between characters and the worlds they inhabit, we’ll dig deep into family systems theory and psychoanalytic theory. Texts for the course will be drawn from recent decades of American literature; novelists may include Jhumpa Lahiri, Richard Russo, Anne Tyler, Jonathan Franzen, and Dorothy Allison."

			"This seminar is designed to compliment studies in literature and/or creative writing through the examination and application of rhetorical and composition (writing) theory. You will learn basic rhetorical analysis methodology. Rhetorical analysis examines what makes arguments effective for a specific purpose, audience, and context. By learning this methodology, you will improve your close reading, critical thinking, and writing skills—hallmarks of a graduating English major. You will also read and discuss contemporary composition theory, investigating what writing is, how it comes into being, and how it circulates. You will apply what we learn to issues, practices, and text (literary, digital, visual, and non-academic) to analyze contemporary uses of rhetoric and writing theory.

			"This natural science course explores contemporary changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through the lense of paleoecology. Paleoecology is literally the study of past ecology, using proxy records (charcoal, pollen, nutrients) to understand the development of existing modern ecosystems as well as on-going and future changes in response to climate change, invasive species, and the intensification of agriculture. These changes are in part the basis for proposing a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Students learn about the sediment coring and other “natural” archives, isotopic dating, and proxy-based reconstruction of ecosystem properties. The course will be taught using readings from the primary literature and will provide hands-on opportunities to learn more about paleoecology."

Students learn anatomical terminology, identify select bones (major features, articulations) and muscles (locations, actions), and analyze their influence during coordinated movement patterns. Students learn joint structure and mechanics, alignment and imbalances, movement behavior, conditioning needs, and injury prevention. Students learn to notice, measure, experience, sense, and reflect upon the impact of anatomical characteristics and anomalies. Offered annually. Prerequisite: students taking this course should have previous experience in a movement intensive practice similar to dance, athletics, or exercise science. Offered annually in the fall semester."

			"Memorializing the Past. \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" George Santayana's famous line about the importance of historical awareness suggests that “the past” can be readily recalled instead of carelessly forgotten. But since recollection — whether through memory or historical accounts — is a social act in which people interpret and negotiate the meaning of events, remembering is more challenging than Santayana implies. This seminar focuses on the tensions that emerge when we try to capture the past by memorializing it. What are the benefits of relying on inscriptions and objects to stimulate memory, and what are the drawbacks? Why was opposition to the Disney Company’s proposed historical theme park so fierce that it abandoned the project? Is the national Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. — a site that is more controversial than you think — well justified? We’ll explore responses to these and other questions as a way to improve our writing about the past. Readings include selections from Plato, Pierra Nora, Philip Gourevitch, Michael Eisner, Alison Landsberg, Elie Wiesel, and Roger Rosenblatt"

This course draws heavily on biological psychology and students learn about techniques in neuroendocrinology to better understand cellular function, neural circuits, and the display of behaviors. Team-based learning and case studies are used to explore the endocrine system, sexual differentiation, the stress response, thirst and digestion, and reproductive behaviors. The experimental evidence upon which our understanding of hormones, brain, and behavior is constructed is emphasized."

			"Fandom, Entertainment, and the Shaping of Fan Identity. Often, the things we like aid us in forming new connections with others who have similar interests. Does this mean the entertainment we consume informs who we become, or that it reflects who we already are? Fan practices, objects of fan devotion, and fans themselves are incredibly varied, yet they are the seeds that form subcultures and unite thousands. In this seminar, we will examine the history of fan culture as well as the current state of fandom. Students are welcome to introduce their own fandoms and fan experiences to written assignments and class discussions. Major assignments will include an investigative essay, a review, and a research paper. In addition to real-world examples of participatory culture, we will also consider depictions of fandom within fictional narratives that both critique and cater to fans, such as Ready Player One, Supernatural, and Galaxy Quest."
