How do different contexts, such as family, clan and community, national and international relations, affect biblical perspectives on justice? Where do we see biblical writers wrestling with problems posed by the apparent lack of justice? Can there be love without justice, or justice without love? A major focus of the course will be on the ways contemporary reading communities address lingering problems caused by unjust uses of the Bible, for example, in questions of gender, race, and power.

Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions. Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment. Guided by these considerations, we will address four main themes involving food and biblical traditions: (1) distributive food justice; (2) food production and care of the land; (3) food and just treatment of animals; and (4) food choices as religiously meaningful.","18","","","","","David Booth","0/0","S","100","18","Bible/Culture/Commun","Open to Environmental Conversations students only.;Section Title: Land, Food and Justice in Biblical Traditions","121","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '14:00'}","False","False","L","1","0/0","","C","20161","Bible in Culture and Community","Research","2016"

The globe continues to warm, ice continues to melt at an alarming pace, and the seas continue to rise. Climate change is already happening. Yet, according to a 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center, only 41% of Americans cited climate change as a major threat. So what gives? Why aren’t people getting the message? Are we delivering it wrong? Do we need more stories and better storytellers? This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? We’ll frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels). In class, students write responses to assigned reading or films, work in small writing groups to give and receive feedback, and work on exercises that take up a certain element covered in our writing handbook.

Our seminar will examine the impediments and the possibilities for such conversations by looking at various matters: the environmental mantra “Think Globally, Act Locally”; the environmental framework of “Integral Ecology” and its relation to Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudago Si; food production in the United States; and St. Olaf College’s efforts to be good stewards of the non-human world.

From immigration to abortion, from gun rights to bathroom rights, from vaccinations to marijuana use, many of us feel strongly about the issues that we care about. But from where, exactly, do our deepest held beliefs emerge? And how do we actually change the minds of others—or ourselves? In this seminar, we’ll use moral psychology to consider the roots of belief and the human capacity for change. Students will investigate an issue they care about through a variety of lenses: personal reflection, research, argument/debate, and interview/immersion with an “other” viewpoint.

This seminar will address an unsettling claim made by a number of recent American and Anglophone artists: that the seemingly mundane acts of self care and domesticity, of finding and maintaining work, of being with others on the other side of normal, entail daily encounters with direct and hidden forms of violence. From Margaret Atwood's dystopian fictions of authoritarian patriarchy and Claudia Rankine's harrowing, poetic account of living as an African-American citizen of the United States to Alex Gibney's documentary film on military torture Taxi to the Dark Side, and Kendrick Lamar's recent album about growing up in Compton, Good Kid, M.A.A.D.

The “corpse” of the title refers to the human bodies in the texts we will study —bodies that may experience pleasure, suffer pain and even martyrdom, and ultimately decay, as the spirit experiences some kind of afterlife. However, despite conceptions of the afterlife, the dead remained an important presence for the living, as intercessors, apparitions, ghosts and saints. The “corpus” is the body of a text—a story that is revisited by artists over time, in an afterlife of its own, as Shakespeare re-writes Hamlet or The Revenger’s Tragedy is re-imagined by Alan Cox in a postmodern film.

"0000109464","1.0","0000000432","ENGL","In this course we take a close look at the work of three writers who address the social challenges facing the United States during the turbulent interwar years. The dramatic consequences of the Great Depression only tell part of the story. America was also deeply affected by the aftershock of World War I, the rise of communism (and later fascism) in Europe, class struggles at home, women’s liberation, the great migration, urbanization, and modernization, which included revolutionary changes in both transportation and communication (modern journalism, the feature film and public radio broadcasting). In studying Steinbeck, Dos Passos and Agee, we will not only look at how the subject materials of their writings reflect these social changes, but also how the authors developed different -- and in some cases strikingly modern -- textual strategies to engage with this tumultuous era of American history. In addition to Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat, The Grapes of Wrath, and Cannery Row, Dos Passos' U.S.A. Trilogy (The 42nd Parallel, 1919 and The Big Money) and Agee’s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, students will read a variety of scholarly texts that situate these primary works in their aesthetic, cultural, social and historical context.

This course will explore such perceptions from the perspective of writings by Muslim women. There is a longstanding tradition of writing by Muslim women in languages such as Urdu, Arabic, Turkish, Hausa, Swahili, French and English. With a focus on writings in English and some translations, we will discuss writers from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Senegal, and the USA, in the context of Islam and ideologies such as Orientalism, Islamophobia, and Islamic feminism.

George Santayana's famous line about the importance of historical awareness suggests that “the past” can be readily recalled instead of carelessly forgotten. But since recollection — whether through memory or historical accounts — is a social act in which people interpret and negotiate the meaning of events, remembering is more challenging than Santayana implies. This seminar focuses on the tensions that emerge when we try to capture the past by memorializing it. What are the benefits of relying on inscriptions and objects to stimulate memory, and what are the drawbacks? Why was opposition to the Disney Company’s proposed historical theme park so fierce that it abandoned the project? Is the national Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. — a site that is more controversial than you think — well justified? We’ll explore responses to these and other questions as a way to improve our writing about the past.
