What are strategies and actions for solving environmental challenges? What role will I play in Earth's future? (and in my community...). In navigating these questions, students will look through an interdisciplinary lens, engaging with a sustained research paper, creating art, and thinking about how we can take scholarship and personal explorations and translate them into civic engagement.

We will attend concerts and rehearsals, interview musicians, and scientists, all in an exploration of what it means to experience music. We will also work on discovering how culture, society and the common person relates and reacts to melody and rhythm.

We not only explore the histories of technological change (the telegraph, the television, and the internet), but also grapple with the questions they have raised about knowledge, free speech, social fracture, and the future of democracy. Of course, our daily experience of media is deeply personal, and through a series of readings, conversations, and short essays we discover why our media landscape appears the way it does and how we can find a stable and healthy orientation within it.","18","","FYS","0000036173","D","","Patrick Wilz","","S","100","17","Top: The Modern Media","Section topic: The Modern Media: From the Telegraph to Twitter","120","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'HH 205', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'HH 205', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'HH 205', 'start': '10:45'}","False","False","D","3","","","C","20233","First-Year Seminar","Topic","2023"

Can the DTC companies deliver on their promises of determining our ancestry, helping us find family members or assigning our risk for certain diseases? What happens to our data and what are some of the unanticipated surprises - both good and bad - that can result from testing? Students grapple with the ethical and societal implications of DTC DNA testing including the Eurocentric bias in reference databases, the use of DNA to solve crimes, and the right to privacy.
