			"How do animals do what they need to do to survive in all sorts of environments? Why are others able to exist in only very particular conditions? These are the sorts of questions students explore as they navigate the basic systems that provide circulation, ventilation, movement, digestion, and waste removal. Students look at how these processes are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts, in dark, deep oceans, and places in between. Students attend lectures plus one three-hour laboratory per week. In laboratory, they conduct quantitative physiological measurements to assess functions such as temperature control, respiration rates, and salt and water balance. Counts as \"comparative organismal biology\" core category. Offered periodically. Also counts toward mathematical biology and neuroscience concentrations. Prerequisites: BIO 150; BIO 227 or CH/BI 227 recommended."

			"This course provides an introduction to critical concepts and key readings about race and racism that are important to the field of Ethnic Studies. Focusing on identities and communities, students learn about racial formation and difference in U.S. and comparative cultural and historical contexts. How does race intersect with class, gender, nation, and sexuality to produce privileges and oppressions? Students survey the emergence of Ethnic Studies through literary texts including art, creative writing, film, music, popular culture, and/or the sciences to become acquainted with interdisciplinary approaches and how concerns for racial equity and social justice formed this academic field. Offered annually. Also counts toward Latin American studies major and Africa and the African Diaspora and Latin American studies concentrations."

Instead, this course aims to provoke and sustain a semester-long exploration of what it means to be a political actor -- that is, a citizen -- and what it means to think about politics.

Students build upon student teaching to determine the essential knowledge and skills of educators as change agents and their future roles as first-year teachers. Student teachers only. Offered each semester."

We will examine the history of Spanish, Portuguese and French imperialism in the region through the eyes of the people who lived it: indigenous commoners and nobles, enslaved and freed people, women and children, scientists and entrepreneurs. With a specific focus on the history of human interaction with the region’s diverse ecologies and the development of capitalism, on colonial law and the history of race and gender, we will ask how colonial society took shape, how these empires sustained themselves and why they eventually collapsed. Students will gain an appreciation for Latin America’s central role in the modern history of global interconnection and understand how the specific dynamics of imperialism established the foundation for Latin America’s postcolonial history. Also counts toward Latin American studies major and concentration."

			"This course takes an analytical approach to economic reasoning and contemporary issues. The course introduces microeconomic and macroeconomic theories with applications to relevant topics, such as employment, growth, environmental protection, affirmative action, exchange rate fluctuations, taxes, and welfare reform. Students explore economics as an intelligent approach to understanding our daily lives as citizens, workers, managers and consumers. Offered each semester. This course does NOT count toward the economics major, but is the prerequisite for all higher-level economics courses. Also counts toward environmental studies major (social science emphasis) and management studies concentration."

Students are expected to communicate clarity of understanding both orally and in writing. Non-majors are invited to take this course, though its primary focus is a comprehensive preparation for further theater studies. Offered each semester.

			"As they are today, conceptions of sex and gender were hotly debated in early modern Italy. In this seminar, students first explore ideas and debates that shape 21st-century understandings of sex and gender. Then, through an in-depth study of the Roman painter Artemisia Gentileschi (1593-1656), students investigate how current understandings of sex and gender shape the study of women artists from the past. Also considered are the responses of contemporary artists (Gina Siciliano and Kehinde Wiley, among others) to Gentileschi’s work. Course assignments teach students to engage in meaningful discussion on controversial topics, to visually analyze works of art, and to find and evaluate a variety of sources for individual research projects."

			"The word \"utopia\" means both a \"good place\" and \"no place.\" Utopian literature embraces this duality by imagining places better than our own. This course will begin with these literary utopias before considering some of the historical attempts to make a \"good place\" in a real place and time. We'll investigate the common problems that both real and imagined utopias have tried to solve, and we'll seek to understand the roots of these problems. We'll end the semester with a collaborative class project to create a utopian college community. Writing for the course will emphasize research, analysis, argumentation, and reflection."

			"What are the roots of inequality, in America and across the globe? In Caste, her provocative critique of race in American society, Isabel Wilkerson uses multiple stories and personal experience to argue that caste is a code buried beneath the surface of race relations in the U.S. That code uses notions of heredity, group purity, stigma, and enforcement through terror in ways similar to the Hindu caste system's suppression of the Dalits (the Untouchables) and Nazi Germany's scapegoating of the Jews. Does this explanation of social superiority and inferiority hold up against theories of economic competition and the nature of prejudice? Readings include Wilkerson's Caste, Marcus Zusak's The Book Thief, and either Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger or John Okada's No-No Boy. This course requires of students an openness to honest conversation and passion for reading."

			"How can we learn to think more critically and communicate our ideas more effectively by developing our identities as writers? And in so doing, how can we develop our individual and civic identities as activists as well? Course texts and activities will theorize and question the extent to which social factors, such as race, class, gender, age, and ability, impact identity, and the ways in which those identities shape our perspectives, opinions, and actions. This section is writing intensive and focuses intentionally on the writing process. Projects emphasize expressing opinion, analyzing course texts, researching and analyzing how a movement or event presents itself, and responding to opinion. The final activity is to reflect, using words and images, on influences that inform your identity and the person you imagine becoming. We will talk about writing not just as a skill, but as a form of empowerment and agency."

			"Why do people care about the super-rich, ultra-famous, and powerbrokers from Capitol Hill to Hollywood? What inspires everyday consumers to desire more news, content, and connection with the celebrities who seduce and elude them? In the United States (and throughout the world), celebrities are royalty and cultural icons -- venerable symbols that often represent what fans ultimately value. This course applies critical theories of religion and the sacred to make sense of the devotion, rituals, and worship centered around celebrities. Figures from musicians, actors, authors to investors, tech giants, and influencers will provide case studies through which we will interrogate histories of demagoguery, fame, progress, and prosperity in American religious life. Throughout the semester, students will build on critical discourse regarding celebrity worship, fanism, charisma, cults of personality, worship, cultural values, and spiritual practices. These conversations will encourage students to learn methods of inquiry applied within the discipline of religious studies and lead to the acquisition of skills in analyzing historical, sociological, theological, and anthropological texts focused on sacred experience, civil religion, and American life. Students will work individually and collaboratively to develop research questions, investigate resources, and develop public-facing projects."

			"In her 2009 TEDTalk \"The Danger of a Single Story,\" novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie states that we often learn about a topic from one point of view. While that one perspective isn't necessarily bad, it limits our understanding of the topic and, more importantly, of the world as well. In this seminar, we will analyze the idea of the \"single story.\" We'll start by interrogating the single stories we're familiar with in our cultural contexts, academic experiences, and personal lives. Who creates these stories? Why do they do so? How do these narratives take root? We will then seek out works that challenge these master narratives by addressing the same topic from another angle: a different author's perspective, a different discipline's approach, or a different culture's beliefs, to name a few. As we dismantle the idea of a \"single story,\" we will read many narratives, and write our own, and explore a complex, vibrant collection of stories."

			"Habits make up a large part of our daily lives -- the estimates range from 40% to a whopping 90%. Your habits contribute to your happiness, your mental and physical health, and your GPA. Some habits are considered good, some are bad, some simply are, and an ever-growing number of apps have been created to help you track all of these habits. In this seminar we'll explore the science of learning and habit creation, how stress, sleep and health are directly connected, and how harnessing the power of cues can help create habits that can improve your life, for the rest of your life. Course work will include reading, discussion, and an individual behavioral assessment project."

			"Travel is simply defined as going from one place to another, but we commonly restrict its meaning to the description of a physical event. A more expansive idea of travel might point us in the direction of literature and film, and the manner in which they position readers/spectators to travel outside of themselves, or to take in and identify with places and perspectives they have never actually experienced. This seminar asks what it means to travel, including but also moving beyond the physical act, to examine how our understanding of it is transformed in an increasingly connected (and disconnected) virtual world. We will read travel literature and screen films that focus on travel, but we will also more broadly consider the promise of travel embedded in these forms themselves."

			"Evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel has called it \"the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised.\" Language--spoken, signed, and written--may be our most important tool for influencing others and constructing ourselves. This seminar is designed for students interested in the phenomenon of human language: its mutability, its persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we may address include: what's in a name? why do we lie? what words convey apology? how does language matter in our campus community? Readings in non-fiction and drama support class discussions of those questions and also model different writing \"moves.\" During our unit on language in drama, the class will also attend a production of the play we are studying. Students synthesize reading and viewing assignments, discussion, personal experience, and the results of their inquisitive research to write in several modes and genres. The writing process for these assignments integrates substantial time for workshops of drafts and students' reflections on their own rhetorical practices and development."

We'll read theories about Generation Z, a memoir of civil rights and environmental activism, and essays about race, class, and gender as we consider how social factors impact identities and the ways identities shape our perspectives and opinions. This section is writing intensive and focuses intentionally on the writing process. Projects emphasize expressing opinion, analyzing course texts, researching and analyzing how a movement or event presents itself, and responding to opinion. The final project is to reflect, using words and images, on influences that inform your identities and the person you imagine becoming."

			"How does contemporary culture--from popular music, social media, and sports, to education, politics, and religion--shape your sense of self and your understanding of others? In this seminar, we will use American culture to examine questions of identity and difference and the experiences that help us define ourselves as individuals and as members of various communities, including St. Olaf. A through line for the course will be those identity categories that tend to shape our lives in obvious and hidden ways: race, ethnicity, religion, class, age, gender, sexuality, and ability, among others. For example, we will discuss the racial and gender politics of hip-hop, browse the social media accounts of so-called influencers, and consider the relationship between college athletics and economics. This section is writing intensive, and we will focus on all aspects of the writing process. Your assignments will emphasize expressing opinion, analyzing media in various forms, researching how a political or social movement represents itself, and responding to the opinions of others. The final project will be a reflection--using words and images--on those influences that inform your identity and the person you imagine becoming."

We will watch documentaries, read two books (Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics: How the Internet Era is Transforming Politics in Kenya and Why Bother?

			"Friendship is among the most foundational concepts in nearly every age and society, and yet it remains among the most mysterious. Today it commonly refers to people, nations, pets, businesses, and online avatars associated with people we may never have met. Why is friendship so resonant across temporal and cultural contexts and yet so hard to define? Is friendship a preference for individual people or an obligation we have to each and every person we encounter? To what extent is friendship gendered? Does friendship play different roles in different cultures, and if so, how do we talk about intercultural friendships? In this seminar, we'll draw on literature, film, philosophy, journalism, and visual art in order to consider existing philosophies of friendship and to develop our own. Major writing assignments will include a rhetorical analysis and a research project on influential friendships and friendship communities."

The murder of George Floyd spawned a worldwide uprising over racial injustice.

In this class we will explore what the year has meant for teachers, learners and schools through readings, podcasts, personal reflections, class discussions and case studies. What have we learned from 2020 and how can it be used as a set of experiences to foster growth and radical change in education in the years to come?"

			"In her 2009 TEDTalk \"The Danger of a Single Story,\" novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie states that we often learn about a topic from one point of view. While that one perspective isn't necessarily bad, it limits our understanding of the topic and, more importantly, of the world as well. In this seminar, we will analyze the idea of the \"single story.\" We'll start by interrogating the single stories we're familiar with in our cultural contexts, academic experiences, and personal lives. Who creates these stories? Why do they do so? How do these narratives take root? We will then seek out works that challenge these master narratives by addressing the same topic from another angle: a different author's perspective, a different discipline's approach, or a different culture's beliefs, to name a few. As we dismantle the idea of a \"single story,\" we will read many narratives, and write our own, and explore a complex, vibrant collection of stories."

			"As the most recognized expression of physical culture, organized sports occupy a prominent position around the world. For centuries, athletic success--or failure--can and has been used as a tool to make war, peace, politics, and money. This seminar is designed for students interested in the political, cultural, and historical impact of sports and physical culture. You do not need to be a collegiate athlete--or even particularly sporty--to apply! Some of our guiding questions for the semester include: When did organized athletics emerge--and what implications does that hold for us today? How do national and international interests collide in the arena of sports? Can and should sporting achievement be viewed independently of other contexts? How can we understand and analyze sports as \"physical culture\"? What athletic pursuits and other physical cultures matter to our St. Olaf campus community? In this course, we will use tools from the fields of cultural and literary analysis to think, talk, and write about the present, past, and future of sports and physical culture--from the intramural clubs at St. Olaf to international competitions like the Olympic Games. We will analyze historical and contemporary source texts, craft and debate persuasive arguments, research and write about physical culture(s), and reflect on our shared physical, emotional, and critical-rhetorical growth at St. Olaf."

			"Increasingly, we ask ourselves, \"What can I do about climate change?\" Maybe we try to recycle or donate to environmental causes, but we wonder if such actions make a difference. Maybe what we're really wondering is this: how do we live meaningfully in the time of climate change? How do we confront climate anxiety, find joy, and be good ancestors to future generations? To address these questions, we'll discuss environmental media from diverse leaders of the emerging climate renaissance. These voices will take us from the heights of the Arctic to worlds below the earth, through forests that communicate with each other, and into the food cultures of the future. In the process, we'll do civically engaged environmental work with our local Northfield community and dispel the myths that make writing difficult in favor of evidence-based essay strategies. Ultimately, we'll work together to find words and ideas to live responsibly in community--with each other and the more-than-human world. No prior environmental knowledge is required."

			"How are meanings made? How do meanings emerge from making and doing, as well as from seeing and listening, thinking and feeling, and even just being in the same place at the same time? This seminar takes up these fundamental questions, primarily in relation to materials drawn from visual art, poetry, theater, film, and music. It also attends to other ways in which people engage in meaning making, individually and collectively, whether these emerge in everyday life or result from the sustained effort of many people over many years. Throughout the course, creative exercises, creative activities, and creative projects--individual projects and group projects--provide students with opportunities to explore and apply what they have learned about meaning making."

How do artists bring these supernatural elements to material life on stage and screen to facilitate critical conversations about power? This course invites students to engage in deep and nuanced discussion about culture, belief, and imagination, while also learning how artists render critical thinking about race into creative work. Our emphasis will be on reading plays, but we will also look at pop culture like film, music videos, and current TV shows like Lovecraft Country and Reservation Dogs. Authors studied include August Wilson, Marie Clements, Sharon Bridgforth, Aishah Rahman, Manjula Padmanabhan, and José Rivera. Students will lead presentations and class discussions, develop research materials around course texts, and stage theatrical magic themselves!"

			"In what ways do language and race intersect? How do individuals use language to signal their belonging to a given community as well as to distinguish themselves from others? How are particular languages, dialects, and ways of speaking involved in the construction of privileged or stigmatized identities? This course will explore the varied and sometimes surprising intersection of language, race, and identity. We will look at linguistic discrimination and how it impacts the survival of non-dominant languages and cultures, the educational success of children, equity in the workplace, and inter-racial/ ethnic conflict. We will also analyze the explosion of linguistic appropriation, such as white teens’ use of black vernacular English or the casual use of the Hindi religious term \"namaste\" in American yoga settings. Readings will be drawn from the emerging field of Raciolinguistics, but we will also look at examples of linguistic stereotyping and discrimination on social media platforms, in film and advertising, as well as in our policing and judicial systems. You will have the opportunity to design and propose an original, relevant final project on a topic and in a format of your choosing."

			"Increasingly, we ask ourselves, \"What can I do about climate change?\" Maybe we try to recycle or donate to environmental causes, but we wonder if such actions make a difference. Maybe what we're really wondering is this: how do we live meaningfully in the time of climate change? How do we confront climate anxiety, find joy, and be good ancestors to future generations? To address these questions, we'll discuss environmental media from diverse leaders of the emerging climate renaissance. These voices will take us from the heights of the Arctic to worlds below the earth, through forests that communicate with each other, and into the food cultures of the future. In the process, we'll do civically engaged environmental work with our local Northfield community and dispel the myths that make writing difficult in favor of evidence-based essay strategies. Ultimately, we'll work together to find words and ideas to live responsibly in community--with each other and the more-than-human world. No prior environmental knowledge is required."

We will read sci-fi novels and short stories in addition to watching a selection of sci-fi film classics. Finally, you will read scholarly texts on both specific works and the genre as a whole."

			"From Black Power to Black Lives Matter, from the Combahee River Collective to the Crunk Feminist Collective, the concept now known as intersectionality was first theorized by feminists of color in the 1970s and continues to provide a crucial lens for grappling with questions of identity, power, and social justice. In this course, we will think and write alongside intersectional writers and activists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Kimberlé Crenshaw, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde as we build more complex understandings of the relationships between gender, race, sexuality, class, and other aspects of identity. Through encounters with many types of texts--including poems, personal essays, scholarly articles, videos, manifestos, and social media posts--you'll sharpen your critical thinking, close reading, argumentation, and research skills. You will not only write about intersectionality, but also will practice intersectional methods--teasing out nuances, imagining new frameworks, and holding in mind conflicting ideas--that will allow you to grow as a writer and person. Assignments will include individual essays, a presentation in pairs, and a group podcast that discusses research-based, practical applications of intersectionality for everyday life, our campus community, and the wider culture."

			"In the 1940s a new and dark form of filmmaking emerged in the United States that challenged the formulaic, romance-driven plots that comprised much of Hollywood cinema during and after WWII. Labeled film noir by the French critics who viewed and admired them across the Atlantic, these American films focused on crime, morally ambiguous characters, and a society in despair. In addition to noir classics like The Big Sleep, Double Indemnity, Laura, and The Naked City, students will also watch neo-noir films like Devil in a Blue Dress and Mulholland Drive along with examples of European and Asian noir films. Furthermore, students read supplemental texts that help shed light on the historical evolution of the genre and the aesthetic and social relevance of its heterogeneous forms. May be repeated if topic is different."

			"\"Heritage\" is a term with many meanings. It can relate to cultural and natural landmarks, to artifacts and their production, to languages and other cultural practices, and it is part of a collective identity, but also our individual identities. As an example in the US-context, think of the Statue of Liberty and its symbolic power of freedom and opportunity in the immigration history of this nation. Your own identification as an American may be quite different, depending on your own history and experiences. In this class, we will look at different shapes that \"heritage\" takes on and reflect on how \"heritage\" connects back to us. Through discussions of different texts and project work, we will collaboratively further our understanding of heritage and approach Ole Question 1: In what ways can I understand the world and my role in it?"

We will examine the music, lyrics, and visual and film representations of an array of 1960s musical artists in rock, pop, soul, and folk, from Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin to The Beatles, Bob Dylan and others. We will also trace the relationships between popular music and the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, anti-Vietnam War activism, women's rights, the sexual revolution and the rise of the drug culture. The semester will culminate in a group project in which students will research, analyze, and present their work on the cultural significance of a musical artist or genre."

We will explore the constructed, contested, and ambiguous nature of queer sexuality and its construction in Russian and U.S. popular culture, including literature, history, and film. Starting with basic theories in queer literature, we will explore how queer theory can be utilized to historically understand our contemporary views of gender and sexuality, formation of identity, as well approaches to LGBTQ+ rights in the the United States, Western Europe, and Russia. Rather than myopically understanding Russia and the U.S. as states historically hostile to queer rights, we will see how Russian and American literature and film has created a multitude of identities and sexualities in these societies. Topics will include sexuality and Christianity, modernity, patriarchy, masculinity, etc."

			"Philosophers have increasingly come to recognize the role that social factors play in the production of knowledge, including scientific knowledge. The rise of social media and internet-driven misinformation and polarization have highlighted just how much social networks shape the information we acquire and the beliefs we form. This course will consider social and political issues in epistemology (the study of knowledge and justified belief). It will focus on the role of social factors in the production, dissemination, and uptake of scientific knowledge and misinformation. Questions addressed include: Who are the right experts, and how do we tell? What role does trust play in science? What special epistemic issues arise in the context of the internet and social media? What problems does democracy pose for making the best use of scientific knowledge? Prerequisites: two courses in philosophy, one of which must be either PHIL 235 or PHIL 236, or permission of the department chair."

			"What was natural philosophy? How was it that the sciences and the humanities were once viewed as a shared endeavor, but are now treated as separate? In the Romantic period (ca. 1750-1850), natural scientists were still considered philosophers, and poets and novelists like Mary Shelley first asked critical social and ethical questions about the consequences of scientific breakthroughs (such as in the novel Frankenstein, which we will read). The focal point of this course will be the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, who discovered electromagnetism in 1820, and mentored the other Hans Christian, the fairytale author Andersen. After improving their academic reading, writing, and research skills, students, for their class project, will work together to create a display about Ørsted at the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis."

The time when families launch young adults and young adults develop their sense of individual identities is an exciting stage of family life, full of change and opportunity, tension and confusion. Students will reflect on their own experience and explore relationships in young adulthood with parent and grandparent figures, siblings, and romantic partners through scholarly articles, novels, media and music. Developmental processes and trends in relationships in a variety of cultural contexts, as well as reflection on narrative examples, will be included. Students will write several short essays as well as work together on a group project to demonstrate their learning."

			"We've much to learn from the witches of the past. Not, of course, how to curse our enemies or brew love potions. Instead, witchcraft and magic are components of the supernatural that will help us understand cultures of the past (including the recent past), and the people who produced them. We'll learn about what the alleged witches thought of themselves, and how magic helped them (and those around them) understand their world. While magic and witchcraft have had some place in human societies for millenia (and still today!), those presumed to wield that power have been accepted or rejected to varying degrees. Accusations of witchcraft, moreover, have also historically been employed to rob others of power. As we will discover in this course, witchcraft and magic are implicated in social, economic, and political histories, and are heavily tied into gender construction and the history of women."

			"This course examines the development of theories of deviance, violence, and crime in East Asia from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We cover topics such as the development of forensic science, court systems, police forces, and prison systems; the evolution of academic and practical fields related to deviance, including criminology, penology, eugenics, and psychology; and the global shift from corporal punishment to rehabilitative-minded custodial sentencing. Although these shifts in theories and approaches to crime were part of a global process, for twentieth-century East Asian nation-states they were particularly informed by the violence of Western imperialism and the struggle for sovereignty. Students examine how desires for building a modern nation-state influenced these conversations on crime and punishment, as well as how these punitive projects intersected with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality, often resulting in the incarceration of marginalized groups."

			"The Cherokees called it Nunna daul Tsuny, \"The Trail Where We Cried,\" and it is now often referred to as the \"Trail of Tears,\" the forced expulsion in the 1830s of indigenous people from their ancestral homes principally in the southeastern United States. That such an unjust event ever occurred calls us to question many assumptions about U.S. history: Why did this happen and how? How did it affect the people involved? What were the after-effects of the forced expulsion to Indian Territory in what is now the state of Oklahoma? This course will explore these and many more questions in an attempt to paint a comprehensive portrait of the era of Removal, broadly construed. Topics covered include Native American culture change, the development of U.S. Indian policy, Native American accommodation and resistance to Removal, and Andrew Jackson’s legacy as the architect of this policy. Most importantly, this course will challenge us to see the Removal process from the Native Americans’ perspective by introducing students to ethnohistory, a methodology developed to write the histories of people long thought not to have had one. In the end, we will see U.S. history in a new light and reflect upon the moral ambiguities of the U.S. republic’s expansion and growth."

			"By exploring social, cultural, and medical ideas about human sexuality as well as sexual cultures and practices in Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas, we will examine how the study of sexuality alters our understanding of history and the human experience. Sex is more than the sum of its parts. It is pleasure and pain, but it is also a language for categorization, a tool for control, and a site of fear and anxiety. Experiences and ideas about sex were shaped by systemic racism and white supremacy, imperialism, institutional and domestic violence, and political upheaval. We'll focus on sexual practices and identities from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, to better understand sex and sexuality in our own world."

			"This course explores gender performance -- acts which historical subjects engaged in through bodily markers such as hair, clothing, posture, and voice, but also through relationships, labor, and domestic roles -- in East Asia during the long twentieth century. This expansive definition of gender includes new formations of gender identity and the body, such as the regional (and global) phenomena such as the New Woman/Modern Girl; East Asian masculinities and the \"Sick Man of Asia;\" women's oppression and liberation; changing divisions of labor; and changing understandings of transgender identities. Students read a selection of primary sources in translation and scholarly secondary sources, as well as produce a final research paper which focuses on gender in its many forms -- masculinities, femininities, and boundary-transgressing performances. This class takes as a matter of course that gender was a central aspect of human history and identity, but asks further, how was gender a major force that shaped, reoriented, and unsettled the path and futures of modern East Asia?"

			"\"Heritage\" is a term with many meanings. It can relate to cultural and natural landmarks, to artifacts and their production, to languages and other cultural practices, and it is part of a collective identity, but also our individual identities. As an example in the US-context, think of the Statue of Liberty and its symbolic power of freedom and opportunity in the immigration history of this nation. Your own identification as an American may be quite different, depending on your own history and experiences. In this class, we will look at different shapes that \"heritage\" takes on and reflect on how \"heritage\" connects back to us. Through discussions of different texts and project work, we will collaboratively further our understanding of heritage and approach Ole Question 1: In what ways can I understand the world and my role in it?"

Beyond their reputation for violence and military prowess for which they may be more commonly known, the Mongols' brief control of the world stage had farther-reaching consequences than the terror and subjugation of the Eurasian continent as they influenced language, trade, religion, and more. In this class, we will use primary source readings from the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries to get a closer look at the human lives and histories of those living in China, Japan, Mongolia, Persia, as well as Europe. As the class unfolds, we will use these histories and topics to build skills like reading sources in-depth, basic research knowledge, and academic writing using those research skills."

We will explore themes such as war making; state and nation-building; empire, colonialism, and territorial expansion; the nature of national power; the role of race and gender; concepts of civilization; and economic growth and market economics to develop a broad understanding of U.S. foreign relations. We will look at how U.S. actions have affected and changed the wider world and examine how interactions with people, places, events, and ideas defined as \"foreign\" have transformed American life."

We examine the 1619 Project, which foregrounds the introduction of slavery to North America, the 1776 Project, which locates patriotism as an essential element of history education, and Educating for American Democracy, which emphasizes civic understanding. At its core, this course asks students to consider history as a space of conflict for the present and the future."

			"How does attending college affect students? This seminar will consider emerging adulthood development in the context of higher education, developmental trajectories of college students, and theories of change. We will examine research on college impact, ways of measuring that impact, and how individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity, SES, religion/worldview, academic ability) influence development. Students will engage in individual reflection on their college experiences, and identify ways of promoting optimal development during the college years. Prerequisites: PSYCH 230 and PSYCH 241 or permission of instructor."

Focusing on identities and communities, students learn about racial formation and difference in U.S. and comparative cultural and historical contexts. How does race intersect with class, gender, nation, and sexuality to produce privileges and oppressions? Students survey the emergence of Ethnic Studies through literary texts including art, creative writing, film, music, popular culture, and/or the sciences to become acquainted with interdisciplinary approaches and how concerns for racial equity and social justice formed this academic field. Offered annually. Also counts toward Latin American studies major and Africa and the African Diaspora and Latin American studies concentrations."

In doing so they review the various research methods and theories that form the sociological tradition. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs. Open to all students when taught during the summer. Offered each semester. Also counts toward race and ethnic studies and gender and sexuality studies majors and gender and sexuality studies concentration."

			"Many people consider the Nordic welfare models exemplary for their promises of equality and well-being for all, but history shows that Nordic countries have not always treated people with disabilities well. This seminar examines experiences of and responses to disability in the Nordic region and how disability intersects with other markers of diversity such as race, gender, age, and class. We will ask how we might reimagine the different experiences of people with disabilities as an element of a diverse, equitable society by exploring the representations of people with disabilities in literature, film, art, journalism, and popular culture. Through reading, discussion, writing, and research, we will question how our concepts of bodymind normalcy shape our own understanding of ability and disability."

			"This course offers students an introductory history of the media landscape they currently inhabit--where news, entertainment, fact, and fiction are everywhere we look yet are often indistinguishable from each other. We will cover the history of the modern media, beginning with the transnational networks of communication built in the 19th century, the social transformations of broadcast media in the 20th century, and rapid and global spread of social media in the 21st. This course will not only explore the histories of the technologies involved in these transformations (the telegraph, the television, and the internet), but also the the institutions that have made these technologies so powerful (The New York Times, the BBC, News Corp, and Twitter), as well as the questions they have raised about objectivity, free speech, polarization, and the future of democracy. We will learn that to understand the social, cultural, and political power of the modern media in the present, we first need to know its past."

Students also explore the factors that enable or hinder language learning and whether bilinguals are smarter. These are just some of the fascinating issues addressed in the course that combines study of theory, fieldwork-based analysis of learner language, and pedagogical considerations, including a focus on both English and World Language learners. Offered annually in the fall semester. Required for ESL licensure and TEFL certificate. Also counts toward linguistic studies concentration. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
