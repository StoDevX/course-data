It teaches the ""whole person"" â€“ the development of character and intellectual capacity as well as skill building. Summer Sloyd students will use the sloyd knife, draw knife, axe, brace, and hand saws (as well as some power tools) to explore the intersection of handwork, woodwork, and creativity.
