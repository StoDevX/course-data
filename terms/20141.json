Students look at how these processes are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems and how they vary across the animal kingdom to help organisms survive in dry, hot deserts, in dark, deep oceans, and places in between. In the weekly three-hour lab, they conduct quantitative physiological measurements to assess functions such as temperature control, respiration rates, and salt and water balance.

In doing so they review the various research methods and theories that form the sociological tradition. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs.

			"This is an introductory course for the liberal arts. Students learn study design principles and develop statistical literacy and reasoning. They learn to describe distributions, assess if known distributions fit their data, estimate population values with confidence intervals, and assess statistical significance with hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-square, z-, and t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression). In addition to lectures, there is a weekly computer lab. Not recommended for students who have completed a term of calculus. STAT 110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics, and students should not take more than one; they all can serve as a prerequisite for further courses. Offered each semester."

How did the goal of liberating workers from continual poverty and alienation lead to authoritarianism and mass terror on a scale never before witnessed? This seminar begins with the intellectual history of socialism, communism and other social theories in the nineteenth century meant to produce human progress. Having mapped this terrain, we will consider the rise of totalitarian regimes that appropriated these ideologies in the twentieth century. Topics will include utopian socialism, Marxism, Stalinism, National Socialism in Germany, fascism in Italy and gender and authoritarian regimes."

The Great War that emerges from the distance of a new century is a complex and poignant phenomenon, revealing the truly global scope of the conflict, common and distinctively national challenges of modern war, the everday lives of soldiers and civilians (through the lenses of class and gender), and the ambiguities of the war's legacy (from \"industrial killing\" to ways of mourning)."

Students are expected to communicate clarity of understanding both orally and in writing. Non-majors are invited to take this course, though its primary focus is a comprehensive preparation for further theater studies. Offered each semester."

			"EnvSt 381 Contested Spaces (ARTS/HUMANITIES)- Mark Allister An environmental matter. An impasse. One side wants conservation of habitat and sustainable practices. The other side frames the situation through the lens of jobs and autonomy from government regulation . Why do so many sites and practices become environmentally contested spaces? How do we begin to resolve such impasses? Most work in environmental studies -- and nearly all that is natural science and social science based -- focuses on exterior or objective perspectives, examining structures such as individual subjects or ecosystems or political and economic systems. This seminar will consider contested spaces and the values that underlie arguments about such spaces by also focusing on interior perspectives, the role of emotion, beauty, ideas about the self, cultural mores, and so for th. Students aim to understand an \"integral ecology\" that might reveal all that is at stake in a contested environmental space."

Emphasis is on intersections between literature and intellectual and social history: How well do literary sources reflect actual social practice? How does literary practice shape experience to create works of art? Offered periodically. Counts towards medieval studies major."

In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts towards American studies major and film studies concentration."

			"This course explores the relationship between thought and society and examines how \"reality\" and \"truth\" develop from social practices, including the position from which sociology itself speaks. This relation is central to the meaning of sociology and its implicit critique of other disciplines' claims to truth, such as philosophy and the physical sciences. Students examine how sociology challenges the very idea of what knowledge is. It challenges the hypothesis that knowledge is not ultimately a transcendental thing that exists independently of social practice, but it is something produced in and by such practice.

Peoples around the world create different realities through the ways they conceptualize experience (cultures) and how they organize themselves to do what they need to do (societies). Anthropologists describe and compare cultures and societies, focusing on different aspects such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion and values, economy and technology, cultural and social change. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs. Offered each semester. Counts toward race and ethnic studies and women's and gender studies majors; and Africa and the Americas, race and ethnic studies, and women's and gender studies concentrations."
