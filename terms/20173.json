Its premise is that we are all, to some extent, uninformed and uncritical consumers of media products and services rather than conscientious and socially-minded users of them. In this spirit, the course provides a comprehensive historical overview of the various print and electronic media that have shaped, and continue to shape, our lives. By examining the issues that have influenced the development of the mass media, the course considers ideological, cultural, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. Counts toward American studies major and film studies concentration."

Students interrogate conceptual issues - the interview as narrative, memory, identity, connections, motivations, and the silences inherent in oral history - and how these relate to gender, religion, and class in multiple global settings. Students learn such practical techniques as how to probe social masks, evaluate oral evidence, and the legalities of releasing interviews. Offered annually. Counts toward history major and Africa and the Americas concentration."

Students explore fundamental concepts, including iteration, recursion, object-oriented software design, algorithm efficiency, levels of naming, parallel computing, and computing ethics. Students apply these concepts daily in hands-on homework exercises relevant to fields in the arts, humanities (including digital humanities computations), social sciences, and natural sciences. Includes a team project applying CS to a chosen discipline. No prior experience with programming is expected or required. Offered each semester. One of CSCI 121, CSCI 125, or CSCI 251 counts toward linguistic studies concentration."

			"This is an introductory course for the liberal arts. Students learn study design principles and develop statistical literacy and reasoning. They learn to describe distributions, assess if known distributions fit their data, estimate population values with confidence intervals, and assess statistical significance with hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-square, z-, and t-tests, ANOVA, correlation, and regression). In addition to lectures, there is a weekly computer lab. Not recommended for students who have completed a term of calculus. STAT 110, STAT 212, and ECON 263 all provide an introduction to statistics, and students should not take more than one; they all can serve as a prerequisite for further courses. Offered each semester. Counts toward environment studies major (social science emphasis) and exercise science major."

			"Students encounter the theory of calculus and develop tools for communicating mathematical ideas with technical accuracy and sophistication. The goal is mastery of the concepts (e.g., limit, continuity, derivatives, and integrals) necessary to verify such important results as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the Mean Value Theorem, and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. Emphasis is on theory and on developing the ability to write proofs. Offered each semester. Counts toward computer science mjaor. Prerequisite: MATH 126 or MATH 128, and MATH 220.

			"How do societies collectively remember, and how do they forget? Why do some events and figures from the past loom large in the collective imagination and are memorialized in museums, monuments, literature, film and song, while others of equal importance slip into oblivion? This seminar focuses both on the why of collective remembering and forgetting, as well on the mechanisms by which memories are transmitted over the generations. While some of the literature and specific case studies refer to Latin America, the topics and theoretical literature are broad in scope and can be applied to any geographical region. This course is suitable for students specializing in any of the sub-fields offered by the History Department."

Students are expected to communicate clarity of understanding both orally and in writing. Non-majors are invited to take this course, though its primary focus is a comprehensive preparation for further theater studies. Offered each semester."

			"In recent decades the Nordic countries have been transformed from homogenous nation-states to increasingly plural societies in terms of religion, culture and ethnicity. Immigration from various parts of the world has given the Nordic region a newfound cosmopolitanism, and the response has been both positive and negative. In this course we take a close look at the immigrant experience as presented in both film and literature. We will examine how immigrants negotiate between their past experiences and new homes, and how that in turn challenges conventional ideas about Nordic identities. We will also take a look back at the great emigration in the late 19th century as many Scandinavians made their new homes in Minnesota among other places. In addition to films and novels, class material will include scholarship on world cinema, multicultural literature, immigration, exile, travel and translation."

By studying the language's vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, they not only gain appreciation for its intricacies and nuances but also learn more about their own language and about language in general. Completion of both semesters equips students to translate almost any ancient Greek text with the aid of a dictionary. Offered annually in the fall semester."
