Have the testimonies of artists gone unheard? Even many religious artists talk about the centering which their art making practice brings them, saying, “I can do this for hours, it’s meditation for me.” Is art making a form of meditation? Are there similarities to artistic practice that parallel those of various faith traditions? If so, what are those similarities? In this course students will examine the spiritual aspects, if any, of their own artistic practice in the medium of their choice, in the studio spaces available during interim.
