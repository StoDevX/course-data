Multi-ethnic peoples have always populated the massive geographic area that comes to be known as ""Russia."" How did the state at various times in history seek to integrate, assimilate or rule over ethnic and religious minorities? What were the strategies and practices of imperial rule under the Romanov monarchy? How and why did policies of assimilation alternate with policies of tolerance, and why were these policies unevenly applied? How did the Soviet project define national identity? We will consider these questions over a broad sweep of history with the goal of identifying analytical categories and models that are appropriate to the Russian context. The course will also introduce key theoretical texts on national identity, colonialism and imperialism. We will interrogate these theories and test them against the Russian version of colonial rule -- a colonialism that differed from European models yet, some would argue, has persisted to this day. Finally, we will consider (to the extent possible) the perspective of colonized peoples and what an alternative narrative history of Russian expansion might look like ""from below.""","18","","GHS","","","","Anna Kuxhausen","","S","300","19","Sem: Nation/Empire in Russian Hist","","320","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'HH 522', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'HH 522', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'HH 522', 'start': '14:00'}","False","False","","3","","","O","20223","Research Seminar: Modern European History","Seminar","2022"

This seminar is designed for students interested in the political, cultural, and historical impact of sports and physical culture.

Some of our guiding questions for the semester include: When did organized athletics emerge--and what implications does that hold for us today? How do national and international interests collide in the arena of sports? Can and should sporting achievement be viewed independently of other contexts? How can we understand and analyze sports as ""physical culture""? What athletic pursuits and other physical cultures matter to our St. Olaf campus community? In this seminar, we will use tools from the fields of cultural and literary analysis to think, talk, and write about the present, past, and future of sports and physical culture--from the intramural clubs at St. Olaf to international competitions like the Olympic Games. We will analyze historical and contemporary source texts, craft and debate persuasive arguments, research and write about physical culture(s), and reflect on our shared physical, emotional, and critical-rhetorical growth at St. Olaf.","19","","WRR","0000036257","B","","Matthew O.

The attempt is unjustifiable, but it raises the question: Is there such a thing as a just insurrection? If the liberationist strategy of insurrection almost always fails, is it unjustifiable to violently resist one’s oppressor, even if this is the only viable path to liberation? How would philosophical theorizing (say, ethics and political philosophy) change if it had to start from the premise of oppression rather than a premise of freedom? How does an abolitionist perspective (rather than a gradualist perspective) change how we think about contemporary justice issues--e.g., responsibility for implicit bias or prison reform? Who are the philosophers theorizing the liberationist strategies and virtues necessary to overcome oppression? What do they have to say about these issues, the current state of professional philosophy, and the power dynamics that limit philosophical thinking? In addition to considering these questions, we will consider liberationist perspectives on racism and antiracism, the relationship of Black Lives Matter to the Black Power movement, the ongoing controversy over Critical Race Theory, and whether it is possible or desirable to study oppressed groups without keeping score about which groups suffer most.

To help us investigate these topics thoughtfully, we will draw from literary nonfiction, history, sociology, literary criticism, philosophy, and journalism. These readings will come from both traditional academic sources as well as popular ones. Essays will include a close reading of an image, a researched history of a domestic room or technology, and a response to a philosophical argument about the power of spaces to shape who we are.","19","","WRR","0000036257","D","","Jennifer Shaiman","0/0","S","100","19","Top: Finding Home","Section topic: Finding Home","120","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'RML 421', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'RML 421', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'RML 421', 'start': '10:45'}","False","False","D","3","0/0","","C","20223","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2022"
