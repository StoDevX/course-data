Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions. Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment. Guided by these considerations, we will address four main themes involving food and biblical traditions: (1) distributive food justice; (2) food production and care of the land; (3) food and just treatment of animals; and (4) food choices as religiously meaningful.","15","","","","","David Booth","0/0","S","100","18","Bible/Culture/Commun","Section Topic: Land, Food and Justice in Biblical Traditions;Open to Environmental Conversations students only.;Closed until new student registration in September.","121","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '10:45'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '11:40', 'location': 'OM 305', 'start': '10:45'}","False","False","E","1","0/0","0/0","C","20151","Bible in Culture and Community","Research","2015"

Because food is prominent in biblical narratives it is a useful interpretative lens. Biblical prophets make food central in their vindication of the poor and hungry. Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions. Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment. Guided by these considerations, we will address four main themes involving food and biblical traditions: (1) distributive food justice; (2) food production and care of the land; (3) food and just treatment of animals; and (4) food choices as religiously meaningful.","18","","","","","David Booth","0/0","S","100","18","Bible/Culture/Commun","Section Topic: Land, Food and Justice in Biblical Traditions","121","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '14:00'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '14:55', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '14:00'}","False","False","R","1","0/0","","C","20151","Bible in Culture and Community","Research","2015"

Despite increased interest in these findings, reading about science can be daunting when faced with scientific language, complicated procedures, and abstract analyses. Science writers face the difficult task of translating and communicating technical and complex findings into summaries that lay audiences can easily understand. This can be further complicated as audiences vary widely in their needs, expertise, and expectations, and thus science writers need to adjust their writing styles accordingly. In this seminar, we will read primary science resources, blogs, opinion pieces, magazines, books, and additional texts to explore how science writing can contribute to the public understanding of science.

How might writing about nature help to curtail the slow amble toward devastation around us? In this seminar, we’ll think about the content of nature writing but more importantly about what kinds of writing strategies most effectively promote that content. The subjects we’ll read about will be diverse: from definitions of sustainability to manifestos about hunting, from encounters with weasels to the absence of encounters with golden frogs, from the problems with consumption to the possibilities of cell phones as purveyors of green change. Assignments will include a personal narrative, a sustainability analysis essay, an editorial, and a radical re-creation project.","18","","","","","Kaethe Schwehn","0/0","S","100","18","First-Year Writing","Section Topic: The Nature of Nature Writing","111","{'day': 'Tu', 'end': '11:00', 'location': 'RML 420', 'start': '09:35'};{'day': 'Th', 'end': '10:50', 'location': 'RML 420', 'start': '09:30'}","False","False","M","1","0/0","","C","20151","","Research","2015"

The globe continues to warm, ice continues to melt at an alarming pace, and the seas continue to rise. Climate change is already happening. Yet, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, only 40% of Americans cited climate change as a major threat. So what gives? Why aren’t people getting the message? Are we delivering it wrong? Do we need more stories, and better storytellers? This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? We’ll frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels). In class, students write responses to assigned reading or films, work in small writing groups to give and receive feedback, and work on exercises that take up a certain element covered in our writing handbook.

It is almost impossible to escape digital technologies in our day-to-day lives, including in our academic work – and why would we want to? Digital technologies offer innovative possibilities for refashioning ourselves, creating communities, and producing academic knowledge in the twenty-first century; on the other hand, digital technologies might also prove harmful to meaningful pen-and-paper work that has been done in the liberal arts for centuries. This course will investigate our preconceptions of “new” technologies to continue developing a critical digital literacy for learning and working with technology in the liberal arts. Possible assignments include critical reflection about our experiences with technology, film review, critical literary review, persuasive essay, and researched multimedia project. This course does not require any technological knowledge, and readings will draw from the humanities, social sciences, and technological sciences.","16","","","","","Elisabeth G.

Specifically examining the biblical underpinnings of Protestant renderings of vocation we will address these questions by attending to the relationship between self, God and neighbor in the texts and in their contemporary reception and application.

As in the biblical texts humans today migrate and mobilize, associate and separate, build and destroy in effort to respond to God. This section explores the tension of these lived realities by asking: 1) What authenticates calling in the Bible? 2) Who is called, and to whom? 3) For what purposes are persons called? Specifically examining the biblical underpinnings of Protestant renderings of vocation we will address these questions by attending to the relationship between self, God and neighbor in the texts and in their contemporary reception and application.
