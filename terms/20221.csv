"0000143113","1.0","0000036254","REL","This course addresses how religion - beliefs, practices, values, the ways it functions in society - is reflected in contemporary film. Religion addresses fundamental questions of human existence: Why are we here? How should we live? Why is there suffering and evil? What happens when we die? The course alternates between close readings of central religious texts which probe such questions (including the Jewish Scriptures, the New Testament, and later theologians and philosophers) and films that take up the questions, as well. While the central focus is on Christian and Jewish sources, the course also considers non-theistic perspectives. Through analysis and discussion of both text and film, students begin to form their own answers.","25","","RFV","","","","James Hanson","","S","100","25","God at the Movies: Religion & Film","","126","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '11:50'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '11:50'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'OM 020', 'start': '11:50'}","False","False","B","1","","","C","20221","God at the Movies: Religion and Film","Research","2022"

Today it commonly refers to people, nations, pets, businesses, and online avatars associated with people we may never have met. Why is friendship so resonant across temporal and cultural contexts and yet so hard to define? Is friendship a preference for individual people or an obligation we have to each and every person we encounter? To what extent is friendship gendered? Does friendship play different roles in different cultures, and if so, how do we talk about intercultural friendships? In this seminar, we'll draw on literature, film, philosophy, journalism, and visual art in order to consider existing philosophies of friendship and to develop our own. Major writing assignments will include a rhetorical analysis and a research project on influential friendships and friendship communities.","18","","WRR","0000036257","H","","Brett B.

How do these narratives take root? We will then seek out works that challenge these master narratives by addressing the same topic from another angle: a different author's perspective, a different discipline's approach, or a different culture's beliefs, to name a few.

This seminar is designed for students interested in the political, cultural, and historical impact of sports and physical culture. You do not need to be a collegiate athlete--or even particularly sporty--to apply! Some of our guiding questions for the semester include: When did organized athletics emerge--and what implications does that hold for us today? How do national and international interests collide in the arena of sports? Can and should sporting achievement be viewed independently of other contexts? How can we understand and analyze sports as ""physical culture""? What athletic pursuits and other physical cultures matter to our St. Olaf campus community? In this course, we will use tools from the fields of cultural and literary analysis to think, talk, and write about the present, past, and future of sports and physical culture--from the intramural clubs at St. Olaf to international competitions like the Olympic Games. We will analyze historical and contemporary source texts, craft and debate persuasive arguments, research and write about physical culture(s), and reflect on our shared physical, emotional, and critical-rhetorical growth at St. Olaf.","17","","WRR","0000036257","A","","Matthew O.

In this course, we will think and write alongside intersectional writers and activists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Kimberlé Crenshaw, bell hooks, and Audre Lorde as we build more complex understandings of the relationships between gender, race, sexuality, class, and other aspects of identity. Through encounters with many types of texts--including poems, personal essays, scholarly articles, videos, manifestos, and social media posts--you'll sharpen your critical thinking, close reading, argumentation, and research skills. You will not only write about intersectionality, but also will practice intersectional methods--teasing out nuances, imagining new frameworks, and holding in mind conflicting ideas--that will allow you to grow as a writer and person. Assignments will include individual essays, a presentation in pairs, and a group podcast that discusses research-based, practical applications of intersectionality for everyday life, our campus community, and the wider culture.","17","","WRR","0000036257","D","","Rebecca Klaver","0/0","S","100","18","Top: Intersectionality","Section title: Intersectionality: Writing as a Tool for Justice","120","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'RML 515', 'start': '11:50'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'RML 515', 'start': '11:50'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '12:45', 'location': 'RML 515', 'start': '11:50'}","False","False","D","1","2/0","","O","20221","Writing and Rhetoric","Topic","2022"

While the scientific process gives us tools to better understand our world, the acceptance and broader integration of these findings is often anything but scientific. In this course, we will examine some key developments in modern science (such as the Copernican Revolution in Physics and Astronomy, the Darwinian revolution in Biology and the Cognitive Counter-Revolution In Psychology) to better understand how scientific progress is made. We will discuss how past scientific findings became accepted as the status quo, and how we go about challenging that status quo when new evidence comes to light.
