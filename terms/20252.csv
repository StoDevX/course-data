This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles governing the structure and adaptation of the musculoskeletal system. We will explore how physical forces influence the health and function of our most critical tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, and muscle. The curriculum will bridge the gap between cellular mechanisms (known as mechanobiology) and whole-body function, demonstrating how an understanding of mechanical loading can optimize performance and accelerate recovery. This is a foundational course perfect for those in physical science majors and/or considering careers in the rehabilitation sciences, medicine, or fitness.","27","0/0","","","Paul Yerhot","","S","200","25","Top: Intro to Tissue Adaptation","Full topic Title: Forces that Shape Us: Introduction to Tissue Adaptation;This course is open only to seniors, juniors and sophomores.","291","{'day': 'Mo', 'end': '12:40', 'location': 'SAC 103', 'start': '10:40'};{'day': 'Tu', 'end': '12:40', 'location': 'SAC 103', 'start': '10:40'};{'day': 'We', 'end': '12:40', 'location': 'SAC 103', 'start': '10:40'};{'day': 'Th', 'end': '12:40', 'location': 'SAC 103', 'start': '10:40'};{'day': 'Fr', 'end': '12:40', 'location': 'SAC 103', 'start': '10:40'}","False","False","C","2","","","C","20252","Topics in Kinesiology","Topic","2025"

Viewing and analyzing horror films such White Zombie (1932) and animated features such as Princess and the Frog (2009), we work toward a historical description of how the making of world religions, race, media & representation, and consumer capitalism shaped the ways audiences in North America have come to think and talk about Voodoo.","29","","RFV","","Timothy M.
