Building upon work in the fall EnCon course, students take a deep look at three broad, current environmental issues: climate change, resources, and waste.

Through attention to their own structured and unstructured experiences during the course, students better understand how ordinary people construct \"Chinese\" and \"Asian\" culture and society today. Through multifaceted engagement with multiple sites in China students may visit during their stay, they analyze the role representation and narrative play in both their encounter with and study of Asia. Offered periodically during January Term. Apply through Smith Center for Global Engagement. Prerequisites: at least one Chinese language course or equivalent."

Euclidean, similarity, and affine transformations are studied analytically. These transformations are generalized to obtain results in hyperbolic geometry and used to generate fractals in an exploration of fractal geometry. Dynamic geometry software and hands-on labs are used to explore both the transformations and properties of these geometries. Offered annually during January Term.

Anthropologists describe and compare cultures and societies, focusing on different aspects such as family and kinship, inequality and power, religion and values, economy and technology, cultural and social change. This course is open to first-year students or students in certain accredited programs. Offered each semester.

Through lectures, readings, discussions, field trips, and in-school and co-curricular placements, students gain an understanding and awareness of how race, class, ethnicity, national origin, and gender shape the complex character of urban youth and schools. Students spend one week in orientation activities on campus and two weeks in the Twin Cities. During the time in the Twin Cities, St. Olaf students participate as tutors and classroom assistants during the school day and then assist in various after-school and community programs. The last week of January Term is spent back on campus discussing the experience. P/N only. Preference given to first-year students, but all students may apply. Offered during January Term."

Drawing on a range of disciplinary contexts and research, this course underscores the ways family relationships are constructed, sustained and challenged in society, with emphasis on theories and practice of family communication. Students draw on the relational dynamics studied in the introductory family studies course to transition to elaborating on the complexities of family functioning in U.S. society and beyond.

Students will consider contemporary and enduring questions about aging from multidisciplinary perspectives to explore issues, methods, and theories surrounding what life will be like as people grow older. Students will interact with older adults in the community to understand aging in context. Also counts toward the neuroscience concentration. Prerequisites: PSYCH 125 and PSYCH 230."

And how do the geography and environment of Italy shape both the lore about a city and its actual built environment? To answer these questions, students explore the representations of Italian cities in literature and visual arts and the documented and architectural realities of urban development. The majority of the course focuses on a study of the city of Florence; students make shorter visits to other Italian cities and study the facts and fictions about each city's urban history.

Using data from a variety of contexts and disciplines, students learn to summarize and extract insight from data, create compelling data visualizations, wrangle data, practice literate programming, and explore ethical issues in data science. Offered annually during fall and spring semesters. No prior experience with programming is expected. This course cannot be taken after SDS 264."

Short lectures and in-class activities provide students with the necessary background to analyze primary scientific articles, and small group discussions provide a forum for student-led discourse and critique of these articles. Each student undertakes a literature research project on a topic of their choice; this semester-long project includes regular faculty consultation and peer review. Also counts toward biomolecular science concentration. Prerequisite: BIO 233 or permission of the instructor."

			"The creators in this class transgress the boundaries of gender, genre, and form. Their works tell women’s stories from intersectional perspectives and many emphasize biography, autobiography, or history. However, they also hybridize, mashup, and cross genres and forms. For example, Laura Esquivel’s Like Water for Chocolate is both a novel and a cookbook while Ntozake Shange describes When the Rainbow Is Enuf, which combines poetry, dance, and music, as a \"choreopoem.\" Students will examine the role of the female writer, director, and artist in texts from across cultures. By analyzing how they defy cultural constructs like genre, form, gender, nation, and race, students will appreciate how the texts reveal and redress cultural differences shaped by power, privilege, and inequality."

This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles governing the structure and adaptation of the musculoskeletal system. We will explore how physical forces influence the health and function of our most critical tissues, including bone, cartilage, tendon, and muscle. The curriculum will bridge the gap between cellular mechanisms (known as mechanobiology) and whole-body function, demonstrating how an understanding of mechanical loading can optimize performance and accelerate recovery. This is a foundational course perfect for those in physical science majors and/or considering careers in the rehabilitation sciences, medicine, or fitness."

			"In this course, popular myths, slurs, and mythologies around images of Voodoo religion are examined through histories of the African diaspora and interpretations of religion and cultural contact in Black Atlantic studies. While providing students with a fundamental understanding of African Diaspora Traditions such as Conjure (USA), Vodou (Haiti), Obeah, Kumina, Revival Zion and Rastari (Jamaica), Spiritual Baptist (Tobago), and Yoruba (USA & Cuba), media and film representations of Haitian Vodou and Voodoo in the Lower South are central sites of investigation. Viewing and analyzing horror films such White Zombie (1932) and animated features such as Princess and the Frog (2009), we work toward a historical description of how the making of world religions, race, media & representation, and consumer capitalism shaped the ways audiences in North America have come to think and talk about Voodoo."

			"Using methods from public health and literary studies, students critically analyze the role of storytelling in medical encounters. In reflection papers and close-readings, students ask how memoir, film, and poetry highlight the layers of meaning and power dynamics that doctors and patients navigate. Students also volunteer with community partners to create quilts and bandages for hospitals and package them with other medical supplies, telling their own stories about the experience. Offered periodically in January term. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."

			"This course examines the relationship of psychoanalysis to critical social theory. Students are introduced to classic psychoanalytic texts and works in critical theory that creatively take up or challenge them. Students are encouraged to develop their own perspectives on ethical issues surrounding human subjectivity, gender and sexuality, race and coloniality, and the possibility of progress -- as well as debates about psychoanalysis as an agent of oppressive normalization versus a force for liberatory social change. Offered periodically in January term. Prerequisite: WRIT 120 or equivalent."
